/**
 * Reconciles a verified student payment into Collections as a receipt.
 *
 * A portal payment became cash when it settled, so this does not record a
 * receipt — it *reconciles* one that already exists. Three consequences shape
 * every line:
 *
 *  - **Only a proven movement is importable.** A rehearsal, an unverified hash
 *    or a payment addressed anywhere but the configured treasury is refused.
 *    Importing one would put a number into a staff-reviewed planning figure
 *    that no chain read supports.
 *  - **The link is unique.** One payment reconciles at most once, and the
 *    evidence fingerprint is derived from the movement, so a second attempt is
 *    a duplicate rather than a second receipt.
 *  - **The overpayment is restricted, not revenue.** The treasury received the
 *    whole amount, but the portion that exceeded the student's debt is owed
 *    back to them. Recording it as spendable cash is how a budget plans money
 *    it may have to return.
 *
 * The amounts are exact six-decimal USDC base units. No currency is implied
 * anywhere: the receipt is USDC, so it can only ever bind into a USDC planning
 * snapshot alongside other USDC, never beside local-currency collections.
