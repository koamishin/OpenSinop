/**
 * Unattended reconciliation of a settled portal payment into Collections.
 *
 * A staff member clicking "Reconcile student payment" is making a decision with
 * the receipt in front of them. This lane makes the same decision without one,
 * so it has to be strictly more conservative than the button, never less:
 *
 *  - **Off by default.** `eduflow.student_tuition.auto_intake` gates dispatch,
 *    and turning it on is a separate, reviewed operator decision.
 *  - **A verified attempt is required.** The historical `tx_verified_on_chain`
 *    flag alone is refused. That flag was written before immutable consent and
 *    write-once settlement evidence existed, and a receipt built on it could
 *    never be planned afterwards — automation must not manufacture a row the
 *    planner will reject.
 *  - **A named owner is the maker.** `prepared_by` records a real, verified
 *    finance account chosen by the operator, never the payer. Maker/checker
 *    separation still applies to it in full: the owner cannot review the
 *    reconciliation it caused.
 *  - **The identity is derived, not generated.** The capture key is a UUIDv5 of
 *    the movement key, so a replay reproduces the identical receipt instead of
 *    a second one, and no scheduler tick can invent a new identity per attempt.
 *
 * Reconciling still creates no authority: the receipt arrives unreviewed,
 * contributes nothing to planning cash, and authorizes no payment.
