# OpenSinop AI — Project Plan & Architecture Roadmap

**Tagline:** Open-source institutional finance agent and payment orchestration, powered by Circle Agent Stack and USDC settlement on Arc.

**Document scope:** Parts 1–5 describe the existing implementation and developer demos. Sections 5–11 define the institution-ready OSS release track; Section 12 records Circle/Arc research and the institution-first architecture; Section 13 catalogs wider operational events. **Section 14 is the authoritative current hackathon pilot scope, delivery order and acceptance contract, including the post-merge student-payment integration in §14.10.** It supersedes older demo priorities, not financial safety or production release gates. **Section 15 separates the merged operator-provisioned student-wallet demo from a production payer/custody design and reviewed vendor destinations.** **Sections 16–18 record current delivery state: admin and finance screens (§16), the two-source fee-to-vendor trace (§17), and the bounded autonomous lane (§18).** Proposed capabilities are not shipped features; a completed demo milestone is not a production-readiness claim.

## Where Things Stand — Start Here in a New Session

### Current reconciliation — assistance safety and finance orchestration

This block supersedes conflicting delivery claims in older dated notes and the legacy assistance demo below. Historical acceptance reports are retained as history, not current certification.

**Assistance now records eligibility, not payment.** `/assistance` keeps exact, idempotent request intake. The older `/financial-assistance` UI remains a compatibility intake/evaluation surface; it no longer calls the simulated payout executor or marks a new request `paid`. Its two-decimal proposal fields are not authoritative payment amounts. The main agent leaves eligible unpaid requests `in_progress` with `requires_authorized_workflow`, not `resolved`. Finance's escalated action records an independently institution-scoped eligibility review only: it neither calls a signer, deducts a fund/wallet, applies tuition credit nor increases the policy-proposed amount. Internal credit and chain payout are distinct workflows. The retired `PaymentService` refuses synthetic settlement. Existing historical `paid`, `executed`, synthetic hashes and approvals are not rewritten or certified by this change.

**Institution safety:** assistance cycles select institution-owned students; staff detail authorization and resource queries restrict institution ownership. Unowned legacy records remain available only in unambiguous single-institution compatibility contexts. This is not shared-database release certification; remaining routes, rejection actions, audit/export and concurrent changes require a full tenant-boundary audit.

**Current inbound orchestration:** verified student-controlled tuition confirmation attempts the existing treasury-scoped admin transaction projection locally before returning; receipt/provider work stays queued. `ReconcileStudentControlledPayment`, leased `StudentReceiptDispatcher` and scheduled `app:dispatch-student-receipts` recover committed inbound work without resending funds. Reconciliation requires configured, verified institution finance intake owner; background classification requires an explicitly configured existing institution admin requester and active publication. Missing configuration is not repaired with generated staff, roles, approvals or MFA. No incoming payment authorizes outgoing spending.

**JEV:** actual provider classification stays behind operator disclosure and advisory switches. Provider failure is a hold, not keyword matching reported as model confidence. TypeSafe rate limits have been observed in development; quota restoration and fresh evaluations are operator work. Old keyword-generated classifications and synthetic reviews require independent audit and forward correction, never silent rewriting.

**Student progress:** persisted payment/receipt/classification/review/planning facts are visible and polled. Browser checks remain unverified because installed Playwright lacks Chromium; server tests do not substitute for browser acceptance. Admin visibility is not proof of institutional revenue or official local-currency tuition clearance.

#### Remaining delivery order

1. Complete institution-boundary and historical-record audits; remove remaining legacy false payment/credit claims. Consolidate compatibility assistance intake into one exact request lifecycle with explicit migration, rather than fabricating links between old tables.
2. Build assistance-specific immutable authorization, durable outbox/attempts, stable no-resend recovery, and matching settlement proof. Existing vendor outbox is not automatically authority for student aid. Eligibility review alone never pays. Implement internal tuition credit separately with exact amounts and its own authorization.
3. Assistance advisory is now queued after the decision commit. `AssessAssistanceDecision` claims persisted queued metadata once; `app:dispatch-assistance-advice` recovers missed wakes on durable queues. Provider failure or stale decision evidence records `needs_review`; commentary never changes financial fields. Recovery parks interrupted running commentary after five minutes without recontacting a provider; changed request evidence is discarded. Operator configuration, PostgreSQL concurrency, browser acceptance and broader tenant audit still remain.
4. Validate student-controlled immutable consent/settlement in reviewed planning receipts; current `ReviewedCollections` still requires the operator tuition-attempt model. Finish source-linked campus-bill reconciliation without synthesized operator consent. Until then, admin receipt visibility does not imply planning eligibility.
5. Finish normal operator source/destination/budget/funding/reservation UI and prove genuine independent human-approved Arc-testnet outflow with unknown-attempt recovery. Preserve unresolved attempts; do not resend to manufacture demo success.
6. Add bounded institution service authority for approved mandates only after human execution acceptance. `AutonomousPipelineBridge` is read-only and cannot generate staff/MFA, accept plans or authorize/disburse. Mandate records/scanner are not unattended payment execution.
7. Rehearse browser, PostgreSQL concurrency, backup/restore, upgrades, private storage and audit export. Mainnet, executable FX/off-ramps and unrestricted shared-school deployment remain separately gated future work, regardless of UI/config options in §20.

**Validation for this assistance correction:** isolated fake-driver assistance/agent/panel/safety suites: 138 tests, 1,224 assertions passed. This establishes no live payout, browser or production readiness. Do not promote these counts to whole-suite or CI claims.

**Automatic tuition intake (2026-10-13):** a settled movement can now be reconciled into
Collections without a staff click, behind `EDUFLOW_TUITION_AUTO_INTAKE` (off by default).
Unattended intake is stricter than the staff button: it refuses the legacy
`tx_verified_on_chain` flag unless immutable consent and verified settlement proof are on the
attempt, requires a named verified finance owner who is not the payer, and derives one UUIDv5
capture identity per movement so replays reproduce the same receipt. The receipt still arrives
unreviewed and supplies no cash. The staff button remains available and unchanged.

**B0 consent and recovery slice (2026-10-13):** the inbound lane now separates quoting from
signing. `StudentTuitionPaymentIntent` is an immutable, digest-bound quote that pins
organisation, student, account, wallet, payer, recipient, principal, fee ceiling, `ARC-TESTNET`/
`5042002`, pilot purpose and expiry; confirmation requires the client to echo the digest and
explicitly accept a bounded fee. `StudentTuitionPaymentProcessor` is the only component that may
ask a signer, only from a `prepared` attempt behind a write-once `submission_started_at` fence, and
every other path observes the existing provider handle or posts from persisted proof. **A live run
is still unproven and deliberately refused:** the installed `circle wallet transfer` has no
enforceable fee ceiling, so `FeeBoundedPaymentTransport` fails closed before invoking the signer,
and both tuition flags default off. See **§14.10.4**.

**Post-merge planning update (2026-10-12):** [PR #14](https://github.com/koamishin/OpenSinop/pull/14),
merged as `207fe89`, adds a student wallet page, live balance reads, staff wallet generation
and **Pay Now** on `/student/dashboard`. The backend quotes a transfer, attempts to send
from a generated student wallet to the configured treasury, writes `StudentTuitionPayment`,
increments tuition `paid_amount`, and can write a `tuition_revenue` transaction. These
records are **not connected to Collections, reviewed receipt bindings, or the budget planner**.
The student `/payments` page still lists assistance/refunds, not tuition receipt history.

**Current release blockers, confirmed from code rather than the PR description:**
`StudentTuitionPaymentService::pay()` posts the tuition/treasury updates even when
`verifyOnChain()` returns false. That verifier checks only transaction presence and returns
true for the fake driver; it does not prove successful, matching USDC movement. Each call
generates a fresh provider UUID; there is no durable pre-send intent/attempt, unique receipt
identity or unknown-outcome recovery. Fee-read failure becomes a zero quote, fee affordability
truncates to six decimals, and treasury posting crosses through floats. The synchronous
gateway path also needs the same agent-wallet acceptance/handle audit as outbound payments.
Merged tests do not establish a genuine end-to-end settled tuition transfer. The PR reports
live wallet creation/faucet funding, not proof of the complete tuition-to-vendor workflow.

**Revised direction:** retain two intake lanes—cashier-recorded cash/bank evidence and direct
student-wallet payments—but converge them into **one source-linked Collections workspace**.
Digital receipts are imported from verified settlement, never retyped as a second manual
receipt. Pending, unknown, unmatched, restricted and simulated amounts stay outside usable
cash. Separate tuition allocation, collection reconciliation, plan review, exact outgoing
payment approval and settlement; a student's payment never authorizes Jev to spend it.
For the current college pilot, direct Arc testnet payments remain clearly labelled pilot
USDC, not real local-currency tuition clearance or college revenue. Generated wallets belong
to the operator's Circle signing context; student key ownership is not proven by a DB link.
See **§14.10** for delivery order, screen behavior, custody decisions and acceptance tests.
This update changes the plan only: no wallet created, payment sent, evidence rewritten or
runtime switch changed.
Planning validation: **62 existing collection and student-tuition feature tests pass
(194 assertions)** using isolated fake/stub gateways. This preserves current regression
behavior, not the stronger verification/recovery acceptance gates proposed in §14.10.

**Admin UI audit and approval redesign (2026-10-11):** Payment Approvals now puts exact
review counts, a short safety notice and the review queue ahead of setup guidance. The shared
admin/finance page uses a ReUI Frame/card/step composition adapted to Blade, not React ReUI
components mounted inside Livewire. It provides a reviewer-prerequisite checklist, explicit
next-step reasons, a visible review-history filter, a three-stage review drawer and expandable
digest evidence. Mobile tables stack into cards. Payment Submissions has a readable navigation
label, exact six-decimal USDC amounts and separate provider-ID/hash/settlement wording; missing
handles never imply no transfer. No payment execution setting was changed. **222 affected
Pest tests pass (925 assertions); the asset build passes.** Chromium browser checks exercised
desktop, finance mobile, dark mode and opening the review drawer with isolated test fixtures,
not live approvals. See **§16.6** for screen availability and remaining work.

**Read this correction before older live-run notes below:** no genuine, independently
human-approved payment has yet been proven through the current workflow. The earlier live
runner used synthetic staff accounts, authenticator factors and purported review evidence;
database records from that runner are not proof of human consent. Outbox #3 remains an
unresolved investigation, with no established provider handle or chain hash. A balance
snapshot, an empty provider-history observation or an HTTP 400 does **not** prove no payment
was accepted. Earlier conclusions that `--quiet` caused the error, or that a fee-shaped response
proved nothing broadcast, remain unestablished. Investigate existing attempts before resending.
The package's published `v2.8.0` has not been adopted here: OpenSinop still locks `v2.7.0`.

**Payment approval navigation (2026-10-11):** `PaymentReviews` is now explicitly registered in the admin panel as **Automation → Payment Approvals**, with a shortcut from Payment Submissions. Previously only the finance route was registered. Both panels retain the existing review policy, independent reviewer/direct permission/MFA requirements, and exact reservation evidence. This UI records authority only; it does not itself submit a transfer. Submission history is read-only, and agent advice is not payment authority. Navigation/rendering and existing authorization/dashboard regressions pass (88 tests combined). Live payment transport and safe unresolved-attempt recovery remain separate blockers.

**The rail is live as of 2026-10-11.** Circle CLI v1.2.1 is installed via npm global
(`@circle-fin/cli`); PATH resolves a stale `mise` shim named `circle` first, so `LEPTON_CIRCLE_BIN`
points at the real binary. The agent session is **authenticated for ARC-TESTNET and ARC** (valid,
~15 days). `arc-canteen` serves `eth_blockNumber`, `eth_getBalance`, `eth_getTransactionReceipt`,
`eth_getTransactionByHash` and `eth_getBlockByNumber` against chain `5042002`. The treasury holds
**64.9 USDC**. `circle terms show` reports Terms **Accepted** — already done, nothing to accept.

**Two real defects were found in the settlement predicate by reading the Arc docs and real receipts,
and both are fixed (`bb99a69`, `23782fd`).** Neither was visible from tests alone, and either one
would have made *every* real payment unreadable:

1. **Transfer logs were read at 6 decimals regardless of emitter.** Arc emits two USDC streams — the
   EIP-7708 native system emitter `0xffff…fffe` at **18** decimals, and NativeFiatToken
   `0x3600…0000` at **6**. A real 30 USDC transfer logged `30000000000000000000`; read as 6 decimals
   that is **30,000,000,000,000 USDC**. Matching is now keyed on emitter address, and an emitter of
   unknown scale is skipped rather than guessed at.
2. **The sender was read from the transaction envelope.** Circle agent wallets do not transact from
   their own address: a real receipt has `from` = relayer `0x9ae75f…`, `to` = delegated account
   `0x0000000071…`, and `value` = 0. The treasury appears **only** as the `from` topic of the system
   Transfer log. Since every payment this system makes goes through an agent wallet, requiring
   `tx.from == treasury` refused all of them as `mismatched`. The sender is now established from
   whichever stream carries the movement; the log is stronger evidence anyway, since it binds the
   sender to *this* movement and cannot be forged.

Also corrected against the docs: **Arc has deterministic finality** — receipts are immediately
authoritative, no reorgs, confirmation count 1. The block read had been *gating* settlement on a reorg
risk that does not exist, so an RPC hiccup could strand a genuinely paid vendor as unresolved
forever. It now supplies corroborating evidence (block hash, timestamp) and recorded
`matched_interfaces`, and can no longer unsettle a payment the chain already made final.

**Validated against three completed Circle transfers on ARC-TESTNET** (30, 45 and 0.01 USDC): all
verify, fees read from receipts (0.006351 / 0.003811 / 0.003185 USDC). Negative controls still
refuse — amount one base unit high, substituted recipient, and a never-broadcast hash all return
`mismatched` / `not_found`, never settled.

**Known gap in the fee ceiling (2026-10-11).** `ArcSettlementVerifier` bounds
`max_fee_base_units` against `gasUsed × effectiveGasPrice` from the receipt, which is the only fee the
receipt can prove. Real ARC-TESTNET transfers show that is *not* the whole cost. For the 30 USDC
transfer, receipt gas was 0.006351 USDC, Circle reported `networkFee` 0.006834, and a further system
transfer of 0.014456 USDC moved from the delegate account to the relayer. For the 45 USDC transfer,
receipt gas was 0.003812 while Circle's `networkFee` and the delegate→relayer amount were both
0.009717. So an authorised fee ceiling of, say, 0.01 USDC would pass while the wallet actually paid
0.0208. The ceiling is sound for *on-chain gas* and silent about Circle's own charge and the relayer
reimbursement. Either bound those explicitly or stop describing it as a total-cost ceiling.

**The live run reached a durable, authorized submission, and stopped at the rail's asynchrony (2026-10-11).**
The whole §14.4 Step 4 human lane ran end to end on the real chain: reviewed destination, reviewed
invoice, closed budget snapshot, funding window, reservation, independent enrolment, MFA-backed
authorization by a named reviewer, and a durable outbox entry. Then `opensinop:dispatch-payment-submissions`
and the worker ran, and the transfer did **not** broadcast.

`circle wallet transfer` without `--quiet` returns a fee preview — `gasLimit`, `networkFee`,
`baseFee`, `priorityFee`, `maxFee` — and submits nothing. The response the executor received was
byte-for-byte the same shape as an explicit `--estimate`, and `circle transaction list` afterwards
showed no new transaction: the newest is still 2026-10-02. **No money moved.**

**This is the remaining gap, and it is architectural.** Circle agent wallets are asynchronous.
`circle wallet transfer --help` states that `--quiet` returns "transaction hash for local wallets,
**transaction ID for agent wallets**". Our wallet is `"type": "agent"`, so even a successful quiet
submit returns a UUID like `116c7ce7-8f2f-53ac-8b06-f18aac151ce3`, not a `0x…` hash.
`CircleCliGateway::transfer()` requires `txHash` in the response and throws without it — correctly,
because it must never record a fake reference — so **every** real agent-wallet payment currently ends
`unknown` with no reference.

The submission path needs three stages, not one: quiet submit → Circle transaction id → poll
`circle transaction list` until the id reaches `COMPLETE` or `FAILED` → take `txHash` → verify on
chain. That also forces a wording decision: after a successful submit but before inclusion the honest
state is *accepted by Circle, not yet on chain*, which is not the same claim as `submitted`, and
`submitted` is deliberately excluded from `DISPATCHABLE_STATES` for exactly this reason. The stop
switch, the lease recovery and the `unknown` reconciliation path all already cope.

**What went right when it stopped, and is worth keeping:** the executor recorded `unknown` with **no**
`provider_reference`, wrote **zero** `transactions`, reported `payments_submitted: 0`, retained the
capacity hold rather than releasing it on a false negative, and `opensinop:reconcile-payment-submissions`
correctly reported "No submitted references await verification" — it did not go looking for a
settlement that never existed.

**Advisory AI lane (2026-10-11) — Jev classification, no authority.** `laravel/ai` v1.0.1 is installed
and `config/ai.php` already defaults `default_for_classification` to `typesafe`. Jev (TypeSafe's
"System One" model) answers classification questions in milliseconds for a small fraction of a text
model's cost, and is reached through `Str::decide($value, $question, $criteria, threshold:, timeout:)`
— a boolean with a confidence threshold — or `Collection::decide()` for routing.

`MandateCandidateRanker` uses it for exactly one purpose: telling a supervisor **which bills might
deserve a standing mandate**, judged on whether the bill recurs and whether its amount is stable. It is
advisory, and the boundary is structural rather than a matter of good intentions:

- `AdvisoryMandateRanking` has no amount, no recipient, no ceiling and no verdict in the type. There
  is nothing in it a caller could promote into a payment even by accident. It records
  `advisory_only: true` and `decides_payment: false` on every row.
- Its output is never fed to `MandateReleaseEvaluator`, which remains a pure function of evidence.
- A model ranking makes a mandate review *faster*; it cannot replace the reviewer who signs it, or the
  deterministic evaluate-each-occurrence step that follows.
- The threshold for "is this recurring" is 0.75 — deliberately high, because a false positive is an
  unattended payment while a false negative only costs a reviewer a moment. A bill with an unstable
  amount is demoted rather than hidden, since a variable bill is exactly where unattended payment is
  most dangerous.
- Fail-closed: no key, an unreachable provider, or a provider error returns null. A missing model
  costs reading time; a model that failed *open* could widen what pays without a human. A provider
  failure discards the whole ranking rather than returning a partial one, which would read as a
  considered judgement about whichever bills survived.

Needs a `TYPESAFE_API_KEY` or `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` and `AiSettings::advisory_enabled` — all unset, so
it degrades to null today, which is the correct default.

**The live run now reaches the rail, and stops at one Circle CLI invocation (2026-10-11).** The full
§14.4 human lane ran end to end on the real chain: reviewed destination, reviewed invoice, closed
budget snapshot, funding window, reservation, independent enrolment, MFA-backed authorization by a
named reviewer, durable outbox entry, and dispatch into the worker.

The transport then submitted and **Circle refused it**:

```
circle wallet transfer 0x48a1… --amount 5 --address 0x19be… --chain ARC-TESTNET
    --idempotency-key opensinop:… --quiet
  → Error: Service returned error 400: Invalid request body.
```

The balance is unchanged at 64.9 USDC and `circle transaction list` shows no new transaction, so
**no money moved**. Two invocations are now ruled out for this wallet:

  - **without** `--quiet`: the CLI answers with a fee preview (`gasLimit`, `networkFee`, `baseFee`,
    `priorityFee`, `maxFee`) and broadcasts nothing — identical in shape to `--estimate`. Verified
    by checking the transaction list afterwards.
  - **with** `--quiet`: the CLI returns HTTP 400 "Invalid request body".

So the working invocation for an agent-wallet transfer is still unknown. `circle wallet transfer
--help` offers only `--amount --token --address --chain --rpc-url --idempotency-key --estimate
--output --quiet`, and the one flag that would force a real submit is the one the service rejects.
Next step is to read the CLI's own reference (`use-circle-cli` skill, `references/cli-operations.md`)
or file a `circle feedback submit` for the missing capability, rather than guess at more flags.

**Also fixed in this pass:** the `unknown` outcome was discarding the provider's actual message, which
made "the rail refused this submission" indistinguishable from "we could not reach the rail" — two
different investigations. The detail is now recorded on the append-only attempt.

**Delivered and tested (2026-10-11):** Section 16 (both panels rebuilt against this plan), the
durable submission outbox, reviewed reservation release, the isolated executor with the Arc
settlement predicate, reviewed funding-window rollover, the standing-mandate lane (§18.4 records plus
the sessionless occurrence scanner), and the enforced nonzero-allowance gate that previously existed
in config but was read nowhere. The legacy `OpenSinopAgent` auto-pay route is **disabled** — both the
vendor and assistance branches now require the authorized workflow. **1400 Pest tests pass
(3 skipped).**

**Not built, in dependency order — this is the critical path:**

1. **Live testnet run** — the environment is ready and the rail is reachable; what remains is the one
   authorisation-to-execution run itself, end to end, with its settlement verified on-chain.
2. **Institution-scoped service authority** — the autonomous scanner deliberately stops at a
   recorded disposition and creates no payment intent. Turning a `release` into a payment needs
   explicit service authority, **not** a fabricated human actor passed to a staff action.
3. **The standing mandate** (§18.4) — delivered; its initial allowance is zero by construction, so
   the lane releases nothing until a reviewer raises a ceiling and the installation flag allows it.
4. **Inbound collection integration** (§12.5, §14.10, §15.6) — PR #14 now supplies student
   wallet/payment records and entry UI. Durable attempts, strong settlement proof, explicit
   payer/custody identity and source-linked Collections/planning integration remain open.

**Ordering corrections (2026-10-10, reaffirmed 2026-10-11):** an earlier revision listed
rollover first. That was wrong. Rollover is an unattended-operation blocker; the §14.4 Step 4/5
human lane already has its 15-minute window in hand. The outbox was therefore built first, then
the executor, then rollover, then the mandate — in that order, and the chain has still never
run live.

**Delivered (2026-10-10): durable submission outbox and attempt identity.**
`PaymentSubmissionOutbox` is written inside the authorization's own transaction, so an
approved payment can never exist without a durable obligation to submit it — the
commit-to-broker gap is closed by construction rather than by a retry. Identity
(`request_key`, `provider_idempotency_key = opensinop:{request_key}`, and every bound digest)
is immutable and stable across replays; only queue progress moves, and a concluded entry can
never be reopened. `PaymentSubmissionAttempt` is append-only with dense numbering, so a gap
means a lost write rather than a silent skip. The submission key is a UUIDv5 derived from the
authorization digest, so re-running the same review recomputes the same identity instead of
minting a second owed payment. A simulated (fake-driver) approval is deliberately **not**
queued: rehearsal must never become work a rail could act on. The runtime
(`EDUFLOW_SUBMISSION_ENABLED`) defaults off and refuses a `sync` connection; the worker
re-reads authority rather than trusting the enqueue moment, treats an expired approval or
expired worker lease as `unknown` to be reconciled rather than retried blindly, honours the
stop switch without erasing evidence or releasing a hold, and **submits nothing** while the
runtime is off — each pass records one append-only attempt and concludes `blocked` with an
explicit reason. `can_execute`, `payments_submitted` and `external_funds_locked` stay false
throughout.

**Delivered (2026-10-11): reviewed funding-window rollover.** A window lives 15 minutes and is
immutable, so an unattended lane had no way to renew. `RollOverFundingWindow` replaces an
**expired** window with a freshly observed, reviewable one, on the same budget allocation, and
only an expired one — superseding a live window would strand the holds and approvals a supervisor
is mid-way through it. The successor still needs `ApproveFundingWindow` like any other window.
Rollover renews the *clock*, never the money: the hold chain is institution-wide and cumulative,
and `ReservationCapacity::verify()` now resolves each historical hold against **the window it was
taken under** rather than the current one, so re-observed cash can never look like corruption.
Approving a successor *retires* the predecessor's approval via `retire()` — a state transition on
otherwise append-only evidence — so exactly one approval is live per institution while payments
already authorized under the old one stay authorized. Lineage (`supersedes_funding_window_id` +
a digest-bound `supersedes` block) is unique per predecessor, so renewal is a chain of distinct
windows rather than a branch, and a successor cannot claim to have superseded a window that had
not actually ended.

**Three things this needed that were not obvious:**

- **`funding_window_approvals.organization_id` was unique**, and its own comment said it held
  "until reviewed rollover/allocation semantics exist". Those semantics now exist, so the
  constraint is dropped and the invariant it used to enforce is held in code: at most one live
  approval per institution, checked under the institution row lock the action already takes.
- **Approval retirement must not touch `content()`.** That method is digest-verified, so retiring
  an approval by editing it would invalidate every payment authorized while it was live. The
  retirement columns are the *only* attributes `updating()` permits.
- **The idempotent-replay path must run before any expired-window guard.** Otherwise a worker
  retrying a hold it already recorded is refused once its window expires, which breaks exactly
  the identity-stability-across-replays property the outbox pattern depends on.


settlement are now separate acts, which is the point. `ProcessPaymentSubmission` can only reach
`submitted` — it re-reads authority, runs a non-broadcasting fee estimate, and submits once
under the outbox's stable `provider_idempotency_key`. `IsolatedPaymentExecutor` is the only
component with signing authority; it refuses unless the runtime is on, the recipient is a usable
address, and the bound rail is Arc *testnet* with no fallback (mainnet is refused even when the
runtime is forced on). A timeout or malformed response is reported `unknown`, never `failed`:
the honest response is to reconcile the existing attempt, because a blind resend risks paying
twice. `ArcSettlementVerifier` is the strict predicate and the only thing that may say `settled`:
it requires successful execution **in a committed block** plus matching sender, recipient and
amount, accepting either the 18-decimal native value or a canonical 6-decimal ERC-20 `Transfer`
log, and refusing an amount present on both rather than double-counting. Its non-`verified`
verdicts are deliberately non-committal about fault — `pending`, `dropped`, `not_found` and
`unreadable` all mean "unresolved, investigate", never "fabricated". That null-lookup-is-
fabrication rule is the specific defect `LeptonReconciliationService` still carries; it is used
by `lepton:reconcile` for historical audit and was deliberately left alone rather than
rewritten under a different verdict vocabulary, but it should not be trusted as settlement proof.

**Four things found while building the above, which must not be regressed:**

- **Fee ceilings were vacuous.** `actualFeeBaseUnits` cast a `BigInteger` quotient with `(int)`,
  which silently yields `1`. Every fee check therefore passed. It is now `->toInt()`, with an
  end-to-end test that drives an over-ceiling fee through the reconciler.
- **A submitted entry must never be re-dispatched.** `submitted` is an *open* state (settlement
  is unproven, capacity stays held) but it is deliberately excluded from `DISPATCHABLE_STATES`,
  because handing an already-sent entry back to a worker is a second submission. Open means owed;
  it does not mean unsent.
- **`transactions.amount` was `decimal(15,2)`,** which cannot hold 6-decimal USDC — a 25.000001
  bill rendered as 25.00. Widened to `decimal(24,6)`. Note SQLite still stores `decimal` as a
  double, so the authoritative amount is the integer `metadata.amount_base_units`; the column is
  a convenience view. The exact settlement evidence also now carries `provider_reference`
  forward, since `reconcile()` was overwriting it on the very step that completes an entry.

**Ordering correction (2026-10-11):** the previous revision of this block said the executor was
the sole blocker and that rollover was still open. Both halves were wrong — the executor now
ships and rollover is delivered. What remains before §14.4 Step 4 can be closed end to end is a
**live testnet run** of the executor path plus an operator decision on testnet submission
authority. After that: the standing mandate (§18), then inbound collection.

**Delivered since the dashboards (2026-10-10): reviewed reservation release.**
`PaymentReservationRelease` + `PaymentReservationReleaseReview`, append-only, maker/checker
where neither the proposer nor the original holder may decide. Capacity comes back without
rewriting the hold or its cumulative chain: `ReservationCapacity` distinguishes the
historical `chainTotal` (what was held, in order, reproducible forever) from
`consumingTotal` (what is unavailable now). An authorized hold can never be released, a
release frees capacity but never money, and `ProposePaymentIntentChange` now unblocks once
the hold is released. `can_execute` remains false throughout.

**Three corrections a new session must not regress on:**

- **The planner cannot choose bills.** `DepartmentBudgetPlanner` walks a closed, staff-selected
  set (`bill_ids`) in due-date order. It may only say *of the bills you approved, these fit
  today's headroom*. There is no bill discovery, ranking or selection anywhere.
- **No model runs in the finance decision path.** Every `AgentDecision::create()` site is the
  legacy *student assistance* path. The vendor-payment chain is deterministic PHP only.
- **A standing mandate, not an agent, decides automatic payments** (§18.1). The SDK's
  `Approvable` seam is for *interactive* approval; the autonomous lane must be sessionless
  and model-free.

**Open decisions for the owner:** §11 items 6 and 7.

**Product direction confirmed by the owner:** Circle Agent Stack and Arc USDC are the primary finance execution infrastructure, not an optional side feature. Keep MIT and one institution per self-hosted instance. Keep **Circle Agent Wallets through Lepton for this hackathon**; Developer-Controlled Wallets remain a later institutional deployment decision. The first finance pilot must operate with zero students. Installation, fake simulation and read-only previews must not submit payments; actual testnet execution requires separate explicit authorization. Mainnet and real college fund movement remain out of scope. LLM advisory stays optional.

**Operating model clarified by the owner:** cashier is the institution's receipt/transaction intake hub; finance/accounting staff supervises event-driven background work and receives approval notifications. Approved recurring bills may run automatically on testnet within a separately reviewed standing mandate. Background activity must not depend on an open browser or a human chat prompt. Sections 14.7–14.10 define this target; no scheduler, supervisor UI or payment authority is enabled by documenting it.

**Current hackathon focus:** Answer **what should the institution do with student fees already collected?** Review realized receipts and propose their permitted use within an existing approved allocation, starting with **one college department, its approved budget and approved bills due over the next couple of weeks**. Cashier-reviewed aggregates/opening funds remain sufficient; no student or assistance record becomes a startup prerequisite. The student payment UI merged in PR #14 is an optional intake lane to harden and connect under §14.10, not a replacement for the college's real local-currency process. Do not count testnet tuition payments as real college revenue or update official tuition obligations from pilot USDC. Each eligible admin-approved bill must produce a linked, verified USDC mirror payment on Arc testnet; read-only analysis plus an unrelated transfer is not completion. Add a separately approved, small capped recurring lane after human-approved payment and recovery paths are safe. See [Section 14](#14-college-shadow-pilot--hackathon-execution-contract).

## 1. Executive Summary & Core Concept

OpenSinop is an institution-owned financial agent: it observes collections and obligations, plans cash use, applies approved spending policy, submits payments through Circle, and reconciles settlement on Arc. Student aid is one workload alongside vendor invoices, donations, subscriptions, and reimbursements—not the agent's identity or startup requirement.

USDC on Arc is the primary operational settlement asset. Institutions may still keep bills and statutory accounts in domestic currency. Current `CurrencyCode` supports USDC, USD, PHP, EUR, GBP, CAD, SGD, and INR; AUD and NGN remain expansion targets. Native-fiat accounting, executable FX and local-bank off-ramps are not complete. USDC settlement does not itself satisfy local payroll, tax, custody or accounting requirements.

Target architecture separates responsibilities:
- **OpenSinop control plane:** Institution identity, counterparties, payable/receivable documents, budgets, reservations, approvals, bounded planning and document-linked accounting evidence.
- **Circle execution plane:** Agent Wallet operations through Lepton; product-specific Wallets, Gateway, CCTP and App Kit capabilities through reviewed adapters. These services move/sign value; they do not know the school's procurement or funding restrictions.
- **Arc settlement plane:** USDC movement, successful execution and deterministic finality. Independently reconcile intended payments against matching evidence; onchain correctness does not prove vendor ownership or goods delivery.
- **Currency/reporting plane:** Exact source/settlement amounts and fees with immutable quote snapshots when conversion occurs. Indicative display rates never authorize an FX trade. Internal tuition credits never imply a USDC or bank transfer.

The product serves school operations, not only accounting or student aid. Finance events
include an expiring learning-platform contract, urgent facility repair, conflicting
purchase commitments, restricted grant receipt, enrollment collection exception or
vendor destination change. Each needs a documented response and accountable owner;
not every event needs a payment or an AI model. Section 13 defines concrete examples.

OpenSinop introduces an **institution-first bounded agent loop**:
> Observe verified balances and documents; reconcile collections; forecast liquidity; propose payment intents; authorize and reserve deterministically; request human review for exceptions; submit through Circle; verify Arc settlement; post accounting evidence.

The existing vendor cycle works independently of student records. C0 now also constructs
the AI operator without an assistance fund or policy and provides read-only institution
inspection. Live vendor-payment safety remains C1/C2 work; student aid is an optional
capability, not the general treasury context.

### Non-Negotiable Security Principles
1. **No Direct LLM Fund Control:** The Large Language Model (LLM) **never** has direct access to private keys or direct authorization to move funds. All decisions are evaluated against deterministic PHP rules and dual-ledger database state.
2. **Fixed-Point Base-Unit Math — Required Release Invariant:** Payment amounts use exact 6-decimal USDC units; currently supported fiat uses 2 decimals. Arc native balances, gas and residuals use 18-decimal integer quantities stored as strings/arbitrary-precision values, never PHP floats or 64-bit casts. Native and ERC-20 interfaces expose the same USDC balance. Legacy treasury/payment floats and two-decimal storage remain gaps.
3. **Locked Exchange Rate Snapshots:** Every decision, reservation, and transaction records an immutable snapshot of the exchange rate, rate provider, and timestamp.
4. **The LLM Is a Proposer, Not an Authoriser:** Model output is advisory only. It may tighten a decision but never loosen one. Every money-moving path is gated by a deterministic predicate evaluated in PHP — see Part 3 §3.1 and §3.2.
5. **A Stored Hash Is a Claim, Not Proof:** Settlement requires successful execution, matching chain/asset/sender/recipient/amount, and the rail's documented finality evidence. Transaction lookup alone is insufficient. Missing lookup results are pending or unknown until investigated, not automatically proof of fabrication. The database ledger is never presented as on-chain funds.

### Part 2: Deterministic Policy Engine & Multi-Currency Conversion (COMPLETED)

#### Objectives

**Current correction:** approval amounts below are eligibility proposals. Neither the policy limit nor finance eligibility review constitutes disbursement authorization; see current reconciliation above.

1. **Currency Conversion & Exchange Rate Layer:**
   - `CurrencyRate` model and repository storing live and fallback exchange rates against USDC.
   - `CurrencyConverter` service converting between USDC base units and any supported fiat/crypto currency using integer scaling.
   - Exchange rate quote expiration and locking (`quote_id`, `rate`, `quoted_at`, `expires_at`).
   - Multi-currency display formatting utility for frontend and Filament panel (e.g. `$100.00 USDC ≈ ₱5,750.00 PHP` or `€92.50 EUR`).
2. **Institutional Assistance Funds & Policies:**
   - `AssistanceFund` model with reserve threshold ($5,000 USDC$) and daily budget limits ($1,000 USDC$).
   - `AssistancePolicyVersion` model with versioned rules for enrollment, GPA, attendance, and semester caps.
3. **Deterministic `EvaluateAssistancePolicy` Action:**
   - Check enrollment status (`enrolled`).
   - Check academic status (`qualified` or threshold GPA).
   - Check attendance threshold (e.g. $\ge 85\%$).
   - Check outstanding tuition balance ($> 0$).
   - Check student semester assistance cap.
   - Check fund minimum reserves and daily budget.
4. **Autonomous Limit vs. Human Review Split:**
   - Single autonomous limit: **$100.000000 USDC** (or converted local currency equivalent at locked rate).
   - Example ($150 USDC requested / ~₱8,625 PHP):
     - Automatic approved portion: **$100.000000 USDC** (~₱5,750 PHP).
     - Escalated human-review portion: **$50.000000 USDC** (~₱2,875 PHP).
     - Status: `partially_approved` with pending escalation.
5. **Agent Decisions & Dual-Currency Audit Logs:**
   - `AgentDecision` capturing exact evaluation rules, pass/fail checks, locked exchange rates, and split amounts.
6. **Filament Staff Actions:**
   - Staff eligibility review/reject actions in the Finance Panel. These do not submit funds or settle tuition.

### Part 3: AI Agent Layer (Laravel AI SDK)

**Status: SDK installed; advisory layer and approval seam shipped and tested.**

`laravel/ai` v1.0.1 is installed. The four agents, two tools, and advisory boundary exist;
the plan previously reported 27 adversarial tests. Advisory and conversational wiring
are described below. These implementation milestones do not certify production safety
or external-provider availability; fresh release CI remains required.

Shipped:
- `AssistanceAssessor`, `TreasuryAnalyst` — `HasStructuredOutput`, advisory only.
- `AskOpenSinopAgent` — conversational, read-only, no tools.
- `SettlementOperator` — `Conversational` + `HasTools`, proposes via tool calls.
- `DisburseAssistance` — `Approvable`; `needsApproval()` **is** the policy engine, and
  `handle()` re-evaluates rather than trusting the earlier verdict.
- `RecordHardshipContext` — not approvable, writes advisory only.
- `AdvisoryEnvelope` / `AdvisorySanitizer` / `AdvisoryGate` — allowlist, fail-closed.

Two findings from reading the SDK rather than assuming it:
- An agent that pauses a tool must be `Conversational` (or be handed history via
  `withMessages`), or resuming throws `ApprovalNotResumableException`. `SettlementOperator`
  uses `RemembersConversations` for exactly this reason.
- `continue()` and `continueOrStart()` do **not** verify participant ownership. Any route
  resuming a conversation must call `ConversationStore::conversationBelongsTo()` first.

Also shipped: admin-configured providers. `ai_providers` holds endpoints with an
encrypted `api_key` cast, managed under `Settings -> AI Providers` (any SDK driver,
including `openai-compatible` for Ollama, LM Studio, vLLM, LiteLLM or a gateway).
`AiProviderResolver` resolves an admin provider ahead of `.env`, per request, and
`AiSettings` gates every call behind two separate switches plus an opt-in for settlement
proposals. Keys are never rendered back into the edit form.

The advisory gate is wired in. `EvaluateAssistancePolicy::recordDecision()` writes the
authoritative decision row first, then attaches commentary under a namespaced `advisory`
key. The action now records queued assistance-advice metadata and dispatches after commit.
`AssessAssistanceDecision` calls the provider in a worker and writes namespaced commentary
only; recovery dispatch sweeps committed queued rows. Provider calls no longer delay the
policy action. A claimed interrupted job remains review work rather than being blindly replayed. Prior live gateway
checks are development observations, not reproducible release evidence.

Verified live against an OpenAI-compatible gateway proxy, which shaped two design decisions. It ignores
`response_format: json_schema`, so agents also request the JSON shape in their
instructions and the gate decodes a string response. And `AiProviderResolver` must return a
built `Provider` instance rather than the driver name, because a bare name resolves against
`config/ai.php` and fails with "requires a default text model".

`AskOpenSinop` is now conversational. The deterministic answer is computed first and is always
the floor; `StudentBrief` hands the model the facts *and* that explanation, and `QnaGate`
replaces the text only when `BriefGuard` finds every figure in the response inside the brief.
Verified live against the configured gateway: it rephrases the split explanation correctly,
refuses to discuss moving funds, and a fabricated balance falls back to the computed figure.
`conversationBelongsTo()` is called inside the gate, not at the route, so no caller can skip it.

Replacing the matcher also surfaced a live routing bug. `str_contains($q, 'usd')` matched
"USDC", so any question quoting an amount was answered about exchange rates, and `'aid'`
matched inside "paid". `answer()` and `query()` also carried separate keyword chains that had
drifted apart, so a question could be answered from the policy and labelled `general`; there is
now one `classify()`.

The approval-resume endpoint is in place. `ApprovalResumeGate` is the only route from a human
decision to a paused tool call, and holds six checks: role through the Gate, conversation
ownership, pending-set subset, a tool allowlist that never constructs `Decision::edit()`, target
provenance read from the stored pause rather than the payload, and the settings gate. The request
body is only ever `id => bool`, so there is no field through which an amount or recipient could
arrive. A replay returns `nothing_pending` rather than paying again, and every settlement in the
response is flagged as requiring on-chain verification.

Verified by mutation: removing the ownership check turns 3 tests red, the tool allowlist 1, the
pending-set subset 1, and the replay short-circuit 1.

Building it surfaced a latent defect. `app(SettlementOperator::class)` returns an agent holding
*blank* Organization, AssistanceFund and AssistancePolicyVersion records, because Eloquent models
take no constructor arguments and the container instantiates them anyway. Its `primaryWallet()` is
null, so `DisburseAssistance::handle()` refuses with "The organization has no active wallet" — the
right outcome for the wrong reason, and it behaves differently once a wallet row exists.
`SettlementOperatorFactory` now refuses to build an operator from non-existent records. The SDK
also binds only `ConversationStore` while implementing `VerifiesConversationOwnership` and
`ResolvesPendingApprovals`; resolving those interfaces failed until they were aliased in
`AppServiceProvider`.

Remaining: decide whether to wire `TuitionSettlementService` into the settlement path or delete it.
It still has zero callers.

#### 3.1 Three-Tier Authority Model

The LLM is a *proposer*, never an authoriser. Authority is split into three tiers and the
boundary between them is enforced in PHP, not in a prompt.

| Tier | Owner | Examples | Can move funds? |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Deterministic** | PHP, non-negotiable | limits, reserve math, daily caps, FX rate locking, auto-vs-escalate, vendor allowlist, signing | Only after all checks pass |
| **Advisory** | LLM, clamped by PHP | hardship category, urgency, confidence, review priority, narrative, anomaly flags | Never |
| **Prohibited** | — | approved amount, policy verdict, key material, recipient selection | Never |

**One-way ratchet:** the LLM may only *tighten* a decision. If the deterministic engine
returns `ESCALATE`, no model response can downgrade it to `AUTO_APPROVE`. Any code path
where model output could loosen a decision is a defect.

#### 3.2 The Seam: `Approvable` Tools

The SDK's `Approvable` contract maps directly onto bounded autonomy. An `Approvable` tool
pauses the run before executing, and `needsApproval(Request): Approval|bool` is evaluated
**per tool call against its arguments**. This predicate *is* the policy engine:

```php
class DisburseAssistance implements Approvable, Tool
{
    use InteractsWithApprovals;

    /**
     * The deterministic policy engine, evaluated per call.
     * Within limits -> executes autonomously. Over limit -> pauses for a human.
     */
    protected function needsApproval(Request $request): Approval|bool
    {
        $result = $this->policy->evaluateStudentAssistance(
            requestedAmount: $request['amount'],
            org: $this->org,
            wallet: $this->wallet,
        );

        return $result->isAutoApproved()
            ? false
            : Approval::required($result->reasoning);
    }
}
```

The model decides *what to propose*; `needsApproval()` decides *whether a human must sign*.
This replaces the current arrangement where the agent writes directly to
`CircleWalletService` — the transfer becomes a tool call that cannot bypass approval.

#### 3.3 Structured Output as the Contract

`HasStructuredOutput` with `schema(JsonSchema $schema)` produces schema-validated output,
removing the hand-rolled `validateSchema()` in `DecisionExplainer`. The advisory schema is
an **allowlist** — advisory fields only, never `approved_amount` or `decision`:

```php
public function schema(JsonSchema $schema): array
{
    return [
        'hardship_category' => $schema->string()->enum([
            'medical', 'academic_materials', 'tuition_shortfall', 'living_costs', 'other',
        ])->required(),
        'urgency' => $schema->string()->enum(['standard', 'high'])->required(),
        'confidence' => $schema->number()->min(0)->max(1)->required(),
        'narrative' => $schema->string()->required(),
        'anomaly_flags' => $schema->array()->items($schema->string())->required(),
    ];
}
```

Unknown keys returned by the model are dropped before the payload reaches the policy
engine, so a prompt-injected `"approved_amount": 999999` is discarded.

#### 3.4 Agents to Build

| Agent | Type | Role | Authority |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `AssistanceAssessor` | `HasStructuredOutput` | Classify hardship, score urgency, flag anomalies | Advisory only |
| `TreasuryAnalyst` | `HasStructuredOutput` | Forecast narrative, explain reserve risk | Advisory only |
| `AskOpenSinop` | `Conversational` + `RemembersConversations` | Student Q&A over balance, rates, policy | Read-only |
| `SettlementOperator` | `HasTools` (Approvable) | Propose disbursements as tool calls | Gated by `needsApproval()` |

All four use `Promptable`. `AskOpenSinop` uses `RemembersConversations` so chat history
persists to the SDK's `agent_conversations` tables, replacing the stateless `fetch()` POST
in `resources/js/components/ask-opensinop.tsx`.

#### 3.5 Non-Negotiable Invariants

1. **No tool reaches `CircleWalletService` without passing `needsApproval()`.** Every
   money-moving tool implements `Approvable`.
2. **No model output is trusted for arithmetic.** All amounts are integer base units
   computed in PHP. The model never sees or emits an approved figure.
3. **Rate locking stays in PHP.** The model may explain a locked quote; it cannot create one.
4. **The agent must not run in the synchronous settlement path.** Advisory calls use
   `->queue()->then()->catch()` so a provider timeout degrades to the deterministic path
   rather than blocking a payment.
5. **Fail closed.** A missing, malformed, or schema-violating response is treated as
   "no advisory available" and the deterministic engine proceeds alone.
6. **Conversations are not authorisation.** The SDK's `continue()` / `continueOrStart()`
   do not verify participant ownership; the app must call
   `ConversationStore::conversationBelongsTo()` before resuming.

#### 3.6 Provider Strategy

`config/ai.php` supports OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, Azure, Bedrock, Groq, xAI, DeepSeek,
Mistral, Ollama, OpenRouter, and `openai-compatible`.

- **Demo without a key:** the `openai-compatible` driver can target a local Ollama or
  LM Studio endpoint, so the AI layer runs in a hackathon demo with no paid API key.
- **Production:** `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` or `OPENAI_API_KEY` via the SDK's **Failover**
  support, so a provider outage degrades instead of failing.
- Provider selected through the `Laravel\Ai\Enums\Lab` enum rather than raw strings.

#### 3.7 Testing Strategy

`Agent::fake()` removes the network from the test suite entirely — no API key, no cost,
no flakiness:

```php
AssistanceAssessor::fake([['hardship_category' => 'medical', 'urgency' => 'high', ...]]);

// Faking a paused tool call, to assert the human-in-the-loop path
SettlementOperator::fake([
    AgentResponse::fakeWithPendingApprovals([
        new PendingApproval(id: 'call_abc', tool: 'DisburseAssistance', arguments: [...], reason: '...'),
    ]),
]);
```

Faking a structured agent without explicit responses auto-generates schema-conforming
data. Required adversarial tests:

- Model returns `approved_amount` → assert it is discarded, not applied.
- Model returns a verdict of `auto_approve` for an over-limit request → assert the
  ratchet holds and the call still escalates.
- Model returns malformed JSON → assert fail-closed and deterministic fallback.
- Model times out → assert no payment is blocked and nothing is half-written.
- Prompt-injected student statement attempting to override policy → assert inert.

#### 3.8 Planned Files

All shipped. `tests/Feature/Ai/AdversarialAgentTest.php` covers the five scenarios in
3.7, `tests/Feature/Ai/ApprovalRatchetTest.php` the approval seam, and
`tests/Feature/Ai/AiProviderAdminTest.php` plus `tests/Feature/Filament/AiProviderAdminUiTest.php`
the admin provider configuration and key encryption.

Remaining release work:
- Move advisory calls out of synchronous evaluation and settlement paths.
- Approval-resume endpoint, verifying conversation ownership, staff authority, and fresh policy checks (3.5.6).
- Re-run advisory and conversational boundary tests with no provider configured.

### Part 4: Circle / Arc USDC Settlement Layer & FX Off-Ramp Rails (IN PROGRESS)

**Status: Circle / Arc transfer and hash-reconciliation integration exists; production settlement certification and local-currency off-ramping remain incomplete.**

Shipped:
- **Lepton Agent Wallet** via the published `yukazakiri/lepton-agent` package. No CLI
  strings in application code; gateways are injected via contracts.
- **Programmable Disbursements:** the autonomous $100 USDC portion dispatches through
  `CircleWalletService`; the $50 remainder dispatches only after a human authorises it in
  the `/finance` panel via `ApproveEscalatedAction`.
- **Settlement Provenance:** transactions record gateway, base units, explorer URL,
  and simulation metadata. `CircleWalletService::executePayment()` currently writes
  `CONFIRMED` immediately after the gateway returns; production must distinguish
  submission from verified settlement.
- **Reconciliation:** `php artisan lepton:reconcile` checks hashes via
  `eth_getTransactionByHash`, with a Circle history fallback. Existing verdicts are
  `verified` / `fabricated` / `unverifiable` / `ledger_only`; these legacy labels need
  stronger evidence and pending/unknown states before live use. See Sections 5 and 8.
- **Operations truth:** `php artisan lepton:doctor` reports CLIs, Circle auth, treasury
  identity, funding, chain reads, and ledger-versus-chain drift.

Outstanding:
- **Internal Tuition Credit:** `TuitionSettlementService` is now called by escalated
  assistance approval on this branch. It still requires a treasury wallet, uses USDC
  account amounts and lacks atomic/idempotent posting. This is an internal credit, not
  a wallet-free production rail or fiat off-ramp; it does not replace Arc settlement.
- Real Arc Testnet funding: the ledger balance is a demo figure, not on-chain funds.
  Reconciliation must stay honest about the difference rather than presenting the ledger
  as settled.

---

### Part 5: Hackathon Demo & End-to-End Verification

**Current college pilot:** Follow Section 14, not the legacy student-aid walkthrough below.
The target is staff using one department's real approved bills and budget, with each
permitted approval connected to a verified Circle Agent Wallet payment on Arc testnet.
C0 preview and C1 drafts/policy activation alone cannot execute this target.

- **Primary walkthrough (target; remaining C1/C2 work required):**
  1. Show the agreed departmental budget, staff-verified opening funds/realized receipts and
     anonymized bills, all retaining their original local currency and document references.
  2. Explain a pay/hold/escalate proposal with exact source amount, approved USDC mirror
     mapping, policy checks, remaining allocation, reserve/fee protection and due date.
  3. Let authorized finance staff approve or reject. A requested material edit requires a
     reviewed replacement proposal and fresh authorization, not mutation of an approved intent.
  4. Execute each eligible approval through the existing Circle Agent Wallet on `ARC-TESTNET`;
     keep the college's actual payable and bank-payment status unchanged.
  5. Verify successful matching Arc movement/finality, link explorer evidence to the decision,
     and repeat the cycle without another payment.
  6. After explicit standing-policy approval, show one eligible recurring bill using the small
     capped autonomous testnet lane and another requiring human review or a policy hold.
  7. Record staff usage with permission and report approve-as-is/edit/reject/hold counts,
     automatic-versus-escalated decisions and review time against a recorded baseline.

**Legacy assistance developer demo (historical target, not current executable behavior):** Amounts below
are illustrative policy examples, not installation defaults. Read the active policy and
current fixtures for the actual split. Fake and testnet runs must be labelled separately;
neither proves mainnet or local-bank readiness.

- **Legacy Assistance Walkthrough (3–5 Minutes):**
  1. **Student Login:** Juan logs in, seeing a tuition balance displayed in both local currency (e.g., `₱17,250 PHP`) and `300.00 USDC`.
  2. **Assistance Request:** Juan submits an emergency request for `150.00 USDC` (`₱8,625 PHP`).
  3. **Autonomous Evaluation:** Policy engine runs instantly:
     - Verifies enrollment (✓), attendance 95% (✓), academic standing (✓), outstanding balance (✓).
     - Checks autonomous limit ($100.00 USDC / ₱5,750 PHP).
  4. **The Split Decision:**
     - Deterministic policy approves `$100.00 USDC` immediately; the model has no approval authority.
     - Escalates `$50.00 USDC` to human review with exact policy reasons.
  5. **Disbursement & Conversion:**
     - Simulates or executes Circle/Arc testnet payment of $100 USDC to Juan's wallet.
     - Displays live conversion quote and transaction receipt.
  6. **Admin Review:**
     - Finance officer logs into `/finance` and views Juan's escalated request with complete AI reasoning and locked exchange rate.
     - Administrator approves the remaining $50 USDC.
  7. **Audit & Explanation:**
     - OpenSinop answers: *"Why didn't you send the full $150 USDC initially?"*
     - Agent explains the institutional threshold and currency conversion breakdown.

## 5. OSS Readiness Review — Verified Gaps

**Review basis:** Repository source and configuration inspected on 2026-10-02. This is
not a full security audit, live settlement test, or PostgreSQL certification. `.env.example`
exists but editor privacy rules blocked reading it; its defaults are unverified. Existing
implementation work is preserved. Findings below describe the original review; implementation
progress is tracked immediately after the table. No item is closed solely by changing this document.

| ID | Observed gap and evidence | Required outcome | Gate |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| OSS-01 | `auto-release.yml` contains a literal Graphite credential. | Revoke/rotate with its owner, replace with Actions secrets or remove integration, scan working tree and history. Removing the string alone does not revoke it. | Before public release |
| OSS-02 | `DatabaseSeeder` always calls `RolesAndPermissionsSeeder`; that seeder creates `admin@admin.com` with password `password` and superadmin rights, outside a local/testing guard. | Production seeds create roles/settings only. First admin is explicitly bootstrapped with unique credentials or expiring invitation. Test production seeding creates no default users. | Before any school deployment |
| OSS-03 | `CircleWalletService::executePayment()` takes `float`; financial models cast money to floats; legacy financial tables store `decimal(15, 2)`. `EvaluateAssistancePolicy` converts base units to two-decimal floats and casts a daily sum before scaling. | Exact minor-unit money representation across decisions, caps, balances, postings, and gateways. Audit and migrate legacy precision; do not assume rounded historical values can be recovered. | Before production financial use |
| OSS-04 | Payment gateway call precedes wallet/transaction persistence; transfer options omit `idempotencyKey`. `ApproveEscalatedRequest` pays before its later state updates. | Durable payment intent, atomic reservation, unique fulfilment identity, stable provider idempotency, crash recovery and reconciliation before retry. | Before external payments |
| OSS-05 | `LeptonReconciliationService` marks any returned transaction array verified, without execution success or amount/recipient matching; null lookup becomes fabricated; Circle fallback searches only 200 records. | Successful receipt/finality plus expected payment matching; distinguish pending, unknown, reverted, and mismatched. Paginated provider evidence or unresolved status when evidence is incomplete. | Before live USDC |
| OSS-06 | Staff dashboards/widgets use `Organization::first()`; students and academic terms have no institution ownership column in the education migration. | Enforced one-institution installation for initial OSS release; explicit installation institution resolver. No shared-database multi-school claim. | Before school pilots |
| OSS-07 | `CurrencyConverter` uses static fallback rates, assumes USD parity, and creates a new 15-minute snapshot timestamp independently of the source rate expiry. | Separate indicative display rates from executable quotes; preserve source timestamps/expiry, rounding, fees and spread. Hold real FX when valid quote unavailable. | Before FX-sensitive payments |
| OSS-08 | Original review: `TuitionSettlementService` had no caller and wrote a two-decimal transaction amount. It is now wired on this branch but remains wallet-dependent and lacks atomic/idempotent fulfilment. | Tested internal credits with exact money, account ownership/term checks and no duplicate or excess posting; never label a ledger offset as external settlement. | Before enabling internal-credit module |
| OSS-09 | `EvaluateAssistancePolicy` invokes advisory synchronously through `prompt()`. AI switches default off in `AiSettings`. | Keep AI off by default; queue advisory after durable decision commit. Slow/unavailable AI must not delay approval or fulfilment. | Before enabling AI in pilots |
| OSS-10 | Dockerfile uses Bun without a frozen lock, frontend PHP from distro packages, `--ignore-platform-reqs`, starter-kit branding, and an amd64-only helper. Entrypoint checks `/var/www/html` while image root is `/app`. No Compose file found. | Clean, reproducible production image and deployment bundle; matching runtime paths, real platform checks, non-root operation, documented services and architecture support. | Before container release |
| OSS-11 | README is demo-focused; installation docs and `version.json` still identify KoamiStarterKit. Composer hooks enable Blog and run starter-kit setup. `.gitattributes` excludes README from archives. | Product identity and release metadata agree. School installation preserves application code, ships docs, and never invokes scaffold rewriting or demo provisioning. | Before OSS release |
| OSS-12 | CI tests SQLite through `phpunit.xml`; inspected CI has no PostgreSQL job. Auto-release runs independently of CI and tags prereleases as `latest`. Root PHP constraint/README say 8.3+, but locked Symfony 8.1 dependencies require PHP 8.4.1+. | Test actual production DB, concurrency and upgrades; publish only tested commits; isolate preview/stable channels; document a certified runtime baseline. | Before stable release |

### O0 Implementation Progress

- **OSS-01 source cleanup implemented:** Graphite integration and literal token removed.
  Workflow credential regression tests added. Owner revocation/rotation and historical
  exposure review are still required; this blocker is not fully closed.
- **OSS-02 seed safety implemented:** Role seeding creates no users in any environment.
  Explicit `DemoUsersSeeder` owns local/testing defaults; demo `DatabaseSeeder` invokes it.
  Production/staging seeding creates no users or
  demo records. `opensinop:bootstrap-admin` creates the first admin through hidden password
  prompts, refuses existing accounts/second superadmins, and records a secret-free audit.
  Existing default accounts are not deleted or reset; operators must remediate them.
- **OSS-12 release guards implemented in part:** CI no longer commits formatter/refactor
  changes. Preview publication requires successful same-repository push CI and checks out
  its exact commit. Manual publication requires exact-commit CI; preview/draft releases
  cannot update stable `latest`. Ad hoc Docker publication disabled. PostgreSQL coverage,
  runtime/image certification and supply-chain attestations remain open.
- Operator bootstrap/release notes added to README; source archives now retain README
  and changelog instead of excluding them. Foundation PR introduced no schema migration,
  dependency change, live payment or shared-institution tenancy.
- **OSS-06 selection/setup implemented in part:** `InstallationInstitution` uses persisted
  installer identity or matching explicit `EDUFLOW_INSTITUTION_ID`, and exactly one
  organization; missing/invalid/ambiguous context fails closed. Dashboards, wallet doctor
  and settlement operator factory no longer choose `Organization::first()`.
- **Installer foundation:** `opensinop:install` initializes institution/settings through a
  locked DB transaction, without migrating, demo seeding, admin creation or wallet/provider
  I/O. Identical retry preserves state; explicit adoption required for legacy institution;
  conflicting identity/metadata refused. Initial registration, impersonation and AI disabled.
  Settings migration adds persisted installation identity. Eloquent creation of a second
  institution blocked after setup; raw DB access is outside that guard.
- Registration GET/POST now respects disabled registration for installed schools; signup
  still cannot provision staff rights or enrollment. Country validation is code-format
  only. Native-fiat ledger, complete ownership/backfill, data imports and rail safety remain
  open; institution currency metadata alone does not convert legacy USDC accounting.
- **OSS-03 exact-money foundation implemented in part:** Readonly `Money` DTO parses
  plain decimal strings with currency precision/range checks, performs checked arithmetic,
  formats without floats and serializes minor units as strings. Intake uses it and rejects
  invalid amount limits even when called outside a Form Request. Converter uses existing
  Brick Math for overflow-safe integer intermediates. Legacy decision/treasury/payment
  float APIs and two-decimal DB columns remain open; no money schema cutover yet.
- **OSS-07 rate snapshots hardened in part:** Future/expired/over-age/non-positive sources
  excluded, source timestamps/expiry preserved, display rates marked indicative. USD can
  use an actual source rate instead of forced parity. `requireFreshQuote()` rejects fallback
  or unbounded rates; all external-currency snapshots remain indicative, not provider offers
  or executable FX. No live feed/off-ramp or settlement path is certified by this change.
- **Current branch follow-up:** Valid payout-address checks, a base-unit payment entry
  point, daily base-unit snapshots and tuition-credit wiring were added. Legacy float
  balances, provider submission before durable intent and immediate `CONFIRMED` remain;
  those additions do not close OSS-03/04/05 or certify live payments.
- Next: institution-first exact treasury/reservation/payment evidence foundations, then
  a zero-student vendor-payment pilot. O0 still needs credential-owner confirmation,
  dependency/asset review and named owners.

**Strengths to preserve:** MIT already exists; deterministic policy actions, student
intake, role separation, AI opt-in settings, encrypted provider keys, Lepton contracts,
quote snapshots, and fake gateways offer a useful foundation. Do not rewrite working
modules just to introduce a new framework.

**Meaning of “any institution”:** Download, inspect, adapt, and self-host without project
permission or a central account. It does not mean every jurisdiction, currency, school
policy, bank, or payment provider is certified on day one. Publish a capability/support
matrix and grow it through pilots.

---

## 6. Product, License, and Institution Boundary

### 6.1 Initial Product Scope

**First supported finance workflow:** An institution registers its identity, binds an
institution-authorized Circle treasury, imports one verified vendor/bill and budget,
reconciles available USDC, approves or holds deterministically, submits a persisted
payment intent, verifies settlement on Arc and exports document-linked evidence.
Zero `Student`, `TuitionAccount`, `AssistanceFund` or `AssistancePolicyVersion` rows must
be required for this workflow. An AI provider is not required to execute approved policy.

The core supplements existing accounting/SIS systems. It is not a payroll calculation
engine, complete ERP or statutory general ledger. Accept payable documents from those
systems rather than rebuilding tax, payroll or procurement in the first release.
Circle/Arc readiness is mandatory for live finance; installation, read-only operation
and fake-driver simulation remain available without a funded wallet.

| Capability | First finance release target | Later / separately gated |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Institution treasury, verified counterparties, vendor bills and budgets | Zero-student operating baseline | More payable types and country templates |
| Exact money, reservations, bounded approval and evidence exports | Mandatory shared controls | ERP/SIS adapters |
| Circle wallet execution and Arc USDC reconciliation | Primary live rail; certified before launch | More custody models and chains |
| Receivables and inbound matching | Referenced USDC collections and unmatched-funds queue | Crosschain collections and regional onramps |
| Gateway unified balance and x402 service spend | Explicitly separate capabilities | Enable only after capability-specific recovery tests |
| Students, aid and internal tuition credit | Reuse existing modules; never startup prerequisites | Module-specific school acceptance |
| AI document/treasury advisory | Optional; disabled by default | Approved cloud or local endpoint |
| FX/off-ramp, escrow, Earn or Borrow | Not automatic finance capabilities | Provider/legal/security approval per capability |
| Shared hosted multi-tenancy | Not initial scope | Separate isolation/custody review |

An internal tuition credit does not move USDC. Manual bank evidence is a separate record,
not independent bank proof. A local-currency recipient needs an approved off-ramp, not
an invented wallet address or a claim that Circle automatically pays every local bank.

**Counterparty wallets are not institution wallets.** Section 15 is authoritative for who
holds a student or vendor address. The institution provisions one wallet for itself and
never custodies a student's or a vendor's funds. "Receivables and inbound matching" below
additionally requires a §12.5 inbox and an explicit payer identity; "vendor bills"
additionally require a counterparty destination **type** and the settlement predicate that
type implies — an on-chain receipt cannot close a custodian or payout-partner obligation.

### 6.2 License and Sustainable OSS

- **Keep existing MIT license.** Schools may use, modify, redistribute, or sell their
  version while retaining required notices. Do not silently relicense contributors' work.
- Audit Composer/npm dependencies, bundled assets/fonts, model weights, generated UI,
  and container contents for redistribution terms. The root MIT license does not
  override third-party licenses or make Circle/AI services open-source.
- Publish third-party notices and a software bill of materials (SBOM) with release
  artifacts. Record provenance for imported starter-kit code.
- No OpenSinop license server, per-student unlock, mandatory telemetry or maintainer login.
  The institution owns its Circle account/session and pays applicable external service,
  network and ramp fees. Self-hosted OSS does not mean Circle's hosted infrastructure
  becomes self-hosted, free or available in every jurisdiction.
- Revenue options: paid hosting, deployment help, training, migration, custom adapters,
  and support agreements. Hosted service is an operating model, not a separate mandatory
  code license. MIT permits competitors to host forks; accept that trade-off.
- MIT has no warranty or support SLA. Separate commercial agreements from community
  support. Maintainer bandwidth and financial/security expertise constrain release scope.

### 6.3 One Institution per Installation First

**Recommended v1 boundary:** One institution, one installation-owned database, storage,
queue/cache namespace, encryption key, mail configuration, and institution-owned treasury context.
Two schools run two instances, even when an IT provider manages both. Never share their
provider credentials or wallet sessions. Campuses inside one legal institution may share
an instance only under the same access/data policy; separate campus wallets and scoped
campus permissions require additional design.

```mermaid
graph TD
    R[Same versioned OSS release] --> A[School A deployment]
    R --> B[School B deployment]
    A --> AD[School A database and private files]
    A --> AC[School A Circle credentials and treasury]
    B --> BD[School B database and private files]
    B --> BC[School B Circle credentials and treasury]
```

Reuse `Organization` as the institution identity; do not add a competing `School` model.
Persist an explicit installation institution selection. Replace `Organization::first()`
and hardcoded IDs with a fail-closed resolver; reject a missing/ambiguous institution.
Setup must prevent creation of a second active institution on the single-school profile.
Future ownership migrations must backfill and validate existing records, not assign
ambiguous records to whichever organization appears first.

**Future shared hosting:** Do not advertise multi-tenancy because an `organization_id`
exists. It needs memberships, authorization, tenant-bound queries/unique keys, private
file paths, queues/cache, AI conversations, exports, provider sessions, and background
jobs, with negative cross-institution tests. Choose database-per-institution or shared
schema only after an explicit threat model and operational review. No tenancy package
or microservice split is required to ship the self-hosted core.

### 6.4 School Configuration Without Forking

Build on existing settings, `Organization`, and `AssistancePolicyVersion`:
- Name/logo, country, locale, timezone, default/display currencies, contact/privacy owner.
- Treasury network/account model, operational USDC limits, restricted funds, departmental
  budgets, counterparty verification, maker/checker routing and fee/reserve limits.
- Academic calendar, student ID format, tuition categories, attendance/academic eligibility
  and term caps belong to the enabled student-aid module, not institution startup.
- Mail, storage, retention, staff invitation, enabled integrations, and automation mode.
- Policy versions are immutable after activation. Record effective dates and approver;
  preview changes against fixtures/history before activation. Policy updates never
  silently expand an already-approved payment.
- Defaults are conservative: manual release, zero autonomous payout allowance, no
  enabled live rail, AI off, public registration off. Schools must consciously activate
  any automation. Attendance/GPA eligibility is configurable, not a universal rule.

Use typed configuration and existing contracts. Avoid arbitrary executable policy code,
per-school source edits, and a generic plugin marketplace in the initial release.

---

## 7. Distribution, Setup, and Data Portability

### 7.1 Supported Distribution Contract

1. **Primary: versioned OCI container plus Docker Compose deployment bundle.** Same image
   for HTTP, worker, and scheduler roles. Bundle defines PostgreSQL, Redis, persistent
   private files, secret injection, health/readiness, and reverse-proxy/TLS instructions.
2. **Secondary: tagged source release for experienced Laravel operators.** Include lock
   files, migration/upgrade notes, production configuration template, and built frontend
   assets or an exact documented build. Use `composer install`, not `composer update`,
   for a tagged release. No scaffold wizard or repository creation/push in school setup.
3. **Demo profile:** Disposable local deployment with synthetic accounts/data and fake
   gateways. Explicit testnet profile requires operator consent. Demo and production
   data/services must never share an instance. Testnet is not the default school path.

**Initial certification target:** PHP 8.5, Laravel 13, Filament 5, PostgreSQL, Redis,
FrankenPHP/Octane for the packaged runtime. Pin actual image/DB versions and extensions
only after clean-build and migration tests pass. SQLite stays development/test/demo.
MySQL, shared hosting, alternate Octane drivers and ARM64 are not advertised as supported
until their matrix passes. Provide an amd64 image first; remove architecture assumptions
before adding ARM64. Node/npm is build-time only for non-SSR production; SSR, if offered,
needs a separately tested Node runtime. Align toolchain versions and choose one lock-file
workflow; current npm/Bun divergence is not a release contract.

No `--ignore-platform-reqs` in a certified build. Run real platform checks in the runtime
image. Secrets, databases, uploaded files, debug tools, and development artifacts must
not enter an image layer; use an explicit build-context exclusion policy. Public source
archives must retain README and installation/security documentation.

**CLI progress:** `opensinop:install` now initializes institution identity, role-only seeds
and safe settings after separately applied migrations. `opensinop:bootstrap-admin` creates
first admin independently. Full workflow/data onboarding is not complete.
`opensinop:health` remains proposed, not an existing command. Planned health reports readiness
without changing balances or broadcasting payments. Installer never calls `opensinop:demo`.

### 7.2 School Onboarding Flow

1. An operator chooses a supported tagged release, deployment host, data location, and
   internal/external domain. Verify checksum/image digest and follow the production guide.
2. Provision private DB/cache/storage and unique secrets. Set production mode, disable
   debug, configure TLS and SMTP, and generate `APP_KEY` exactly once for a new instance.
3. Run a controlled one-off migration/installation task. Create institution identity,
   unique first-admin credentials or an expiring invitation; lock first-run setup afterward.
   Never ship a public unauthenticated setup wizard or reusable bootstrap token.
4. Admin completes MFA, sets school details/calendar/currency/retention, and invites
   finance reviewers. Run readiness checks and a mail-delivery test. Installation cannot
   be marked ready while password reset/invitations are unusable.
5. Import vendors, payable documents and budgets through a dry-run preview; reconcile
   opening totals with the source system. Student imports are optional module onboarding.
6. Bind an institution-authorized Circle wallet/session to an explicit network; verify
   real balance, signing readiness, recovery owner and applicable policies. Test one complete
   zero-student vendor-payment cycle with fakes, then a separately approved capped testnet
   cycle. Installation never creates, funds or broadcasts a wallet action automatically.
7. Confirm backups, restore/reconciliation, staff roles and live-rail acceptance before
   activating real payments. Start with explicit human release and zero autonomous limits;
   approve bounded automation and AI separately.

Setup is re-runnable without duplicating institution/admin/roles or resetting secrets,
policy, opening balances, or existing records. A partially completed setup can resume.
Production setup never executes `migrate:fresh`, demo seeders, or key regeneration on an
existing instance. Migration and seeding are not HTTP/worker startup side effects.

### 7.3 Imports, Exports, and Local Adaptation

- Start with UTF-8 CSV templates for counterparties/vendors, payable documents and
  institutional budgets; optional student-module templates cover rosters, terms and tuition
  opening balances. Version formats and preserve authoritative external document IDs.
- Require exact decimal strings plus currency code at input; validate exponent/limits,
  duplicates, foreign keys and active term. Preserve stable external IDs and leading
  zeros in student numbers. Parse money without floats; reject ambiguous formatted input.
- Dry-run shows mappings, counts, errors and reconciliation totals before commit.
  Import batches have identity/checksum and row outcomes; safe retries must not duplicate
  students, tuition obligations, or postings. Detect conflicting updates, not overwrite
  financial history. Escape spreadsheet formula injection in exported CSV cells.
- Export records, decision policy snapshots, posting/payment evidence and audit history
  in documented CSV/JSON schemas. Restrict exports to authorized staff; log requests;
  exclude keys/tokens and unnecessary hardship text.
- Provide data exit path independent of a hosted subscription. A school can leave without
  losing its financial/audit records. Integrate SIS/accounting APIs later through scoped,
  documented adapters; do not require a bespoke integration for the first pilot.
- Initial language support is English. Plan translation catalogs, timezone-aware academic
  dates, localized display and accessible/mobile forms; publish actual language coverage.
  Current eight-currency enum is not worldwide accounting support. New currencies with
  zero/three decimals require precision and formatting tests before enabling them.

### 7.4 Cost and Responsibility

OSS source is free; operation is not automatically free. Schools or their IT partners
provide hosting, storage, backups, mail, admin/security time, and Circle/Arc/provider fees.
AI adds optional model/API or local hardware costs. USDC adds network, custody-service,
conversion and off-ramp costs when applicable; gas sponsorship is capped and changeable.
Publish measured pilot sizing and an example monthly cost breakdown; no unsupported
student-capacity or “runs on any server” claim.

| Party | Responsibilities |
| --- | --- |
| Maintainers | Source/releases, supported matrix, security process, migration notes, contract tests |
| School operator / hosting partner | Infrastructure, secrets, TLS, patches, backups, recovery, incident response |
| School finance/privacy owners | Policy approval, segregation of duties, legal basis, retention, reconciliations |
| External provider | Contracted availability, custody/settlement, geography and account eligibility |

---

## 8. Financial Safety and Circle/Arc Execution Boundaries

### 8.1 Exact Money, Ledger, and Currency Semantics

Use exact minor units plus currency for obligations, budgets, decisions, reservations,
postings, payment intents and fulfilment. Reuse existing integer fields where appropriate;
consolidate legacy float APIs behind one money representation. Use PostgreSQL `BIGINT`
with explicit range checks; use existing exact math support for intermediates that may
overflow, not multiplication that silently becomes a float. Never send large integer
money values as unsafe JavaScript `Number`s; expose decimal strings or integer strings
and format at the display edge.

**USDC execution, domestic reporting:** Operational payouts/reservations use exact
USDC amounts. Preserve each bill's original currency/amount and the institution's reporting
currency separately. If currencies differ, record source/settlement amounts and executable
quote, fees, spread and rounding; do not silently turn a display estimate into authority.
USDC is not guaranteed to trade at exactly USD 1; a stablecoin is not an FX provider.

Arc native quantities use 18 decimals, the ERC-20 USDC interface uses 6, and both expose
one balance. Native amounts/gas can exceed `PHP_INT_MAX`: use arbitrary-precision integer
strings, not `BIGINT` for all chain quantities. Convert a 6-decimal payment to native units
by multiplying by `10^12`; preserve native residuals rather than silently dropping them.
Never sum native and ERC-20 balances or count their paired Transfer logs twice.

Do not call the current mutable balances a complete double-entry ledger. Add a focused,
balanced posting journal for budget reservation/release, aid fulfilment, tuition credits,
fees and reversals; link each event to decision/policy/payment evidence. No destructive
balance overwrite as reconciliation. Record adjustments with actor, reason and evidence.
Prevent cascading deletion from erasing financial history. Integrate accounting exports,
not a speculative full ERP/general-ledger rewrite.

Legacy migration requires preflight reconciliation, staging backup, additive fields,
explicit rounding mapping and verified cutover. Existing two-decimal values cannot prove
original six-decimal payments; flag uncertain historical records for review.

### 8.2 Payment Lifecycle and Failure Recovery

Separate **request**, **decision**, **approval**, **reservation**, and **fulfilment/payment**.
Approval is not payment; provider acceptance is not settlement; simulated settlement is
not real settlement. A partially approved request tracks autonomous and human-reviewed
portions separately; a denied remainder cannot roll back an already-settled portion.

Target external-payment states: `created`, `reserved`, `submitted`, `pending`,
`settled`, `failed`, `unknown`, `cancelled`. Keep simulation and internal/manual evidence
types distinct. Do not map the legacy `CONFIRMED` field to successful chain evidence.

1. Authorize caller; validate institution, beneficiary, amount, currency, policy version,
   quote and approval. Verified enrollment/identity and payout destination changes are
   school-controlled; address syntax alone does not prove recipient ownership.
2. In one DB transaction, lock budget/fund/request rows in a consistent order, check
   available funds/caps including reservations, persist intent/reservation and an outbox
   event. Unique keys identify request portion and fulfilment attempt. Commit before
   external I/O; do not hold DB locks over a slow provider call.
3. A worker submits the persisted intent with a stable provider idempotency key. Serialize
   conflicting wallet spends where needed; recheck remaining balance, fees/gas, policy,
   quote and beneficiary authorization. A changed material input needs a new review.
4. Save provider evidence; reconcile before completing ledger postings or tuition fulfilment.
   Crashes, timeouts and ambiguous submissions stay `unknown` until resolved. Queue
   uniqueness alone does not guarantee exactly-once external payments.
5. Retry known-safe operations with the same identity. On provider success plus DB failure,
   recover the existing payment, not send another. Release reservations only after safe
   cancellation/failure proof; failed/unknown payments never become extra spending room.

Human approval cannot bypass authorization, recipient validation, reservations, currency
integrity or available funds. Changing an eligibility rule belongs in a new approved
policy version, not an undocumented `human_override` that skips safety checks. High-risk
payments, payout-address changes and policy changes require configured maker/checker
separation; no self-approval. Read-only auditor role and privileged-action MFA are release
requirements. Provide an immediate stop for new submissions while preserving read-only
access and reconciliation of in-flight payments.

### 8.3 Settlement Evidence

For Circle / Arc, certification needs successful execution receipt/provider settlement
status, inclusion/finality, correct chain and asset, matching treasury, beneficiary,
amount and payment identity. Decode native/system and ERC-20 movements with their
respective emitters/precision; `tx.from` may be a relayer rather than the economic payer.
Gateway/x402 evidence needs its transfer ID, authorization nonce and lifecycle in addition
to any shared batch hash. Provider acceptance or pending credit is not final settlement.
A transaction array returned by `eth_getTransactionByHash` may be pending, reverted,
unrelated, or for a different amount; it is insufficient by itself.

A null RPC result may reflect propagation delay, provider indexing, wrong network or an
unknown transaction. Do not label it fabricated solely from one lookup, and never repay
on that assumption. RPC/history outages leave an unresolved state. History fallback
must account for pagination and verify successful matching payment evidence, not a hash
in a truncated list. If the configured Arc proxy cannot expose the required proof, the
live rail stays disabled until another reviewed evidence source is available.

### 8.4 AI and Provider Boundaries

- Reuse `AiSettings`, encrypted `AiProvider`, advisory DTOs and deterministic explanations.
  AI is off by default and never required for intake, policy evaluation, review or exports.
- Queue advisory after decision commit; bound timeouts, retries, spend and retention.
  Students can still get the deterministic explanation while an optional AI job is pending.
  Later advisory cannot silently rewrite approval or cancel already-settled funds.
- Enabling AI requires institution approval of data handling, legal basis, provider terms,
  retention and approved region. The existing disclosure toggle is acknowledgement,
  not automatically student consent or a lawful basis.
- Minimize/anonymize prompts; hardship text may contain health/family data. No secrets or
  unrestricted student documents in prompts. No provider failover outside the school's
  approved list/regions. Local providers need explicit deployment and model-license review.
- Provider endpoint configuration creates an outbound-request trust boundary: restrict it
  to trusted admins, validate TLS/redirects and egress targets, block metadata-service
  access, and allow private local endpoints only through reviewed policy.
- Agent conversations and approval resumes must check owner, role, institution, current
  policy and request state. Never treat knowledge of a conversation/approval ID as authority.

### 8.5 Rail Enablement and Jurisdiction

No mainnet by default and no silent testnet-to-mainnet switch. A school owns its provider
account/treasury and credentials. Funding and human OTP login remain operator tasks,
never installer/queue side effects. Plan provider-session expiry alerts, restricted session
storage, volume permissions, recovery and monitoring. Official Circle Agent Wallet docs
checked on 2026-10-05 specify 28-day sessions, separate mainnet/testnet sessions and an
OS secure keychain. Actual deployed CLI status is authoritative for expiry; older local
notes saying seven days must not define service behavior. Operator OTP renewal and
headless-container keychain support are readiness gates, not assumed unattended support.

Agent Wallets are user-controlled 2-of-2 MPC, not unilateral Circle custody. Their native
spending-policy changes require another OTP and are documented for mainnet only. The
institution must approve the responsible operator/recovery process. Developer-Controlled
Wallets are a distinct server-side alternative, not a drop-in use of an Agent Wallet
session; their authority and secret custody require separate implementation/review.

Document each rail's countries/currencies, account/KYC requirements, permitted custody,
fees, limits, finality, dispute/refund paths and school approval. Do not promise automatic
fiat off-ramping until a real partner integration and end-to-end proof exist. Financial,
sanctions, privacy and education rules require jurisdiction-specific institutional/legal
review; OSS licensing does not waive them.

---

## 9. Privacy, Operations, and Release Governance

### 9.1 School Data and Security Baseline

- School controls its records; no hidden central telemetry or maintainer access. Optional
  support bundles need explicit opt-in and redaction. Use synthetic public demo data.
- Separate applicant, reviewer, approver, institution admin, infrastructure operator and
  read-only auditor capabilities. Test object-level access for records, private files,
  exports and conversations, not only panel visibility. Disable or strictly audit
  impersonation on financial/AI paths; no silent approval under an impersonated user.
- Require HTTPS, secure session settings, staff MFA, login throttling and tested recovery.
  Public self-registration does not create staff privileges or verified student enrollment.
- Keep hardship evidence private with authorized, short-lived download access, upload
  validation/scanning and access logs. No sensitive proof documents on a public disk.
- Encrypt backups and secrets; document `APP_KEY` custody/rotation/recovery. Never regenerate
  it during upgrade: encrypted provider keys and other protected data depend on it.
- Define retention by data class. Preserve legally required financial evidence while
  deleting/anonymizing unnecessary personal/advisory content. Provide access/correction/
  export/deletion workflows and exception handling. Avoid claiming automatic GDPR/FERPA
  compliance; document responsibilities and deployment-specific controls.
- On-chain addresses/payment amounts are public and cannot be erased. Never place student
  names, IDs, hardship text or private documents on-chain. Explain linkability before
  offering that rail, especially when minors are involved.

### 9.2 Deployment, Backups, and Recovery

A production bundle needs separate HTTP, durable worker and scheduler processes using
the same release. DB and cache stay private; only the TLS entrypoint is public. Configure
worker restart/recycle limits, request-scoped institution/provider state, bounded network
timeouts, queue isolation, logs and graceful shutdown. Reload Octane workers and restart
queue workers after code/config updates. Test consecutive requests for state leaks.

Health must distinguish app liveness from readiness of DB, storage, mail, queue/scheduler
heartbeats and enabled integrations. An optional AI outage is degraded advisory, not
core downtime. A missing payment dependency disables that rail. Monitor failed jobs,
reservation age, unresolved payments, reserve drift, SMTP and provider-session expiry;
never expose secrets/student details through a public health endpoint.

**Proposed small-pilot targets:** RPO at most 24 hours for core school records; RTO at most
4 hours. These are acceptance targets, not current guarantees. Live funds need a separately
approved tighter recovery policy, durable payment identity and reconciliation before
resubmission. Measure both targets through restore drills rather than citing backup success.

Back up DB, private uploads, required configuration, encryption-key material and release
identity with separate access controls. Store encrypted off-site copies; define ownership,
retention and restore instructions. School operators rehearse restoration to an isolated
host. After restore, pause external payments and reconcile with external providers first;
restoring yesterday's DB must not repeat yesterday's settled transfer.

### 9.3 Upgrade and Support Policy

1. Review release notes/support matrix; stage the upgrade against an anonymized copy.
   Check migration preflight, schema and integration compatibility.
2. Freeze conflicting submissions, settle or preserve in-flight intent/reservation states,
   and take a verified backup. Record the current image digest and schema version.
3. Run migrations once through a controlled deployment task. Do not auto-migrate from
   every HTTP/worker replica, seed demo data, reset policies or regenerate keys.
4. Deploy the tested image, refresh configuration caches, reload/restart long-lived
   processes, and run core/rail readiness and reconciliation smoke tests.
5. Resume intake/automation only after checks pass. Prefer forward fixes for applied
   migrations. Code rollback is safe only with a documented compatible schema; restoring
   a pre-upgrade DB is not a safe financial rollback without external reconciliation.

Use additive expand/contract changes and an explicit migration path from the existing
demo schema to the first supported school release. Backups are not a substitute for an
upgrade test. Test the previous supported release upgrading to each new one. Do not
retroactively edit published migrations to repair school databases.

Recommend semantic versioning with separate `preview` and `stable` channels. Choose the
first OpenSinop version after reviewing repository tags; `version.json` currently belongs
to the starter kit, not a certified OpenSinop release. A preview must never update the
stable `latest` image. Operators pin a version/digest; no automatic financial production
upgrade from a moving tag. Release artifacts must identify source commit, SBOM, license
notices, checksum/signature, runtime matrix and known limitations.

**Proposed support promise:** Supported stable minor lines receive critical security fixes
for at least 12 months, subject to compatible dependency support. Name maintainers and
fund that commitment before publishing it; if unavailable, publish a shorter honest
window. Preview releases have no production support promise. Paid SLAs are separate.

### 9.4 Community and Supply Chain

- Add `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `SECURITY.md`, a code of conduct, issue templates, changelog,
  public roadmap and operator guides when the release work is executed. Update existing
  `docs/` instead of keeping starter-kit instructions as the school manual.
- Name a security contact and private disclosure process. Proposed response targets:
  acknowledgement within 3 business days and initial triage within 7; agree maintainer
  coverage first. Payment/authorization/migration changes need two reviewers.
- CI for pull requests validates without committing formatter/refactor changes. Restrict
  workflow permissions; pin trusted build actions, audit dependencies and scan for secrets.
  Never publish from untrusted PR code or accept external credentials in demo fixtures.
- Build/release from the exact commit that passed mandatory CI. Publish tested containers,
  signed provenance and release notes; identify vulnerabilities and unsupported features.
  Keep changelog/README in distributable archives.
- Accept contributions under the project license; document contributor sign-off/provenance
  without introducing a restrictive CLA by default. School user group guides priorities.
  No secrets, student records or real credentials in bug reports or community chat.

## 10. OSS Roadmap, Owners, and Acceptance Gates

**Scheduling rule:** Gates before dates. No fixed launch promise until the blockers are
estimated by named maintainers. Finance foundations, Circle/Arc certification and school
procurement run at different speeds. A read-only/simulated preview can ship before live
certification, but a production payment-agent claim cannot. Do not wait for AI, Earn,
Borrow or local-bank off-ramps to prove the primary USDC cycle. Assign phase owners first.

| Phase | Work and dependencies | Accountable owner | Exit evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| O0 — Repository safety | Rotate exposed credential; production-safe seeds; review tracked history/assets/license notices; choose scope/support owners. No dependency on demo completion. | Security maintainer + project lead | Secret scan clean; token revocation confirmed; production seeding has no known-password/default users |
| O1 — Finance foundation | Exact money/legacy migration, reservation/posting journal, explicit institution context, policy/approval boundaries. Follows O0; precedes school financial use. | Backend/finance maintainer | Precision, authorization, atomicity and policy replay tests pass on PostgreSQL |
| O2 — Institution finance core | Decouple assistance context; treasury observation, verified vendors, payable/collection intents, policy, reservations and evidence exports. Uses O1; can run alongside O3. | Backend + institution finance owner | Zero-student vendor cycle passes with fake rails and no AI; student-module absence cannot disable treasury |
| O3 — Distribution/operations | Clean image/Compose, production template, locked build, health, TLS/mail, backup/restore/upgrade guides, gated releases. Starts after O0; validates O2 release candidate. | Release/operator maintainer | Independent clean install, restart, restore and previous-version upgrade pass |
| O4 — Independent pilots | Two institutions with different budgets/reporting currencies; named finance/privacy/IT owners. Uses O1–O3 and R1 for live payments; start read-only/fake, then capped testnet/live with approval. | Pilot coordinator + school owners | No-student operations, balances, approvals, settlements and exports reconcile; no duplicates; recovery drill and signed review |
| O5 — Stable institution finance | Resolve pilots and mandatory Circle/Arc gates; publish capability matrix, notices, operator docs, owners and signed artifacts. | Release maintainer | O0–O4 and primary live-rail acceptance pass; uncertified advanced capabilities remain disabled |
| R1 — Primary Circle/Arc certification | Durable intents/recovery, Arc-specific evidence, provider policy/session operations, jurisdiction review and capped opt-in live verification. Requires O1/O2; mandatory before live O4/O5. | Payment/security maintainer + institution finance owner | Duplicate/crash/unknown cases tested; real evidence matches; institution approves custody, rail and limits |
| R2 — Optional AI and wider adoption | Async advisory, approved providers/regions, retention, spend limits, translations, SIS/accounting adapters. | AI/privacy + integration maintainers | Core unaffected by provider failure; data/cost controls and per-adapter acceptance pass |

### 10.1 Required Release Test Matrix

Existing tests are a foundation, not proof of the new guarantees. Extend Pest/browser
and CI coverage as each feature is built; use fresh synthetic data, fakes and no payment
credentials in default CI. Real rails use controlled opt-in certification outside routine CI.

| Area | Required assertions |
| --- | --- |
| Clean install | Empty production DB, no API keys or Circle binaries/session, no default users; setup resumes and locks; no network payment occurs |
| Institution/auth | Explicit institution context, missing/ambiguous institution refused, no second-school setup; reviewers/auditors cannot release funds or edit secrets; students cannot read others' records |
| Zero-student treasury | No students, tuition accounts, assistance fund or assistance policy; forecast, vendor review/payment, reconciliation and export still work; empty payable cycle is an audited no-op |
| Money/currency | One minor unit, six-decimal USDC, 18-decimal native gas/residuals, cap boundaries, fractional totals, overflow, quote rounding/expiry and reporting currency; JS precision preserved |
| Concurrency | Concurrent requests/approvals reserve once and cannot overspend fund/daily/term caps; same fulfilment key produces one posting/payment; production DB behavior tested |
| Fulfilment | Internal credit cannot exceed tuition balance; declined remainder preserved; manual evidence/export states honest; reversals append instead of deleting history |
| Provider recovery | Timeout before/after acceptance, worker crash, provider success/DB failure, duplicate delivery and replay after restore cannot create a second payment |
| Settlement | Pending/reverted/wrong chain/asset/recipient/amount/incomplete history stay unsettled; success requires matching finality evidence; dual Arc event streams counted once; fake results never real |
| Gateway/x402 | Correct deposit methods, pending vs available balances, transfer-ID/nonce deduplication, nonunique batch hashes, fee/spend caps, expiry/revocation and replay tested before enabling |
| FX/AI disabled | No required quote for native-currency flow; invalid real FX quote holds payment; disabled AI sends no prompts; slow/malformed/injected AI cannot alter or delay core execution |
| Privacy/operations | Private documents/exports/conversations enforce authorization; keys redacted; backup restore decrypts keys without exposing them; health contains no PII; worker/scheduler recovery tested |
| Distribution | Clean locked production image/platform checks, tagged source archive contains docs; liveness/readiness, persistent volumes and non-root operation pass |
| Upgrade | Previous supported schema upgrades with policies/provider keys/ledger intact; in-flight intent recovery and rollback compatibility documented |
| Accessibility | Keyboard/mobile request and review flows, form errors, contrast and WCAG 2.2 AA target verified in browser checks |

### 10.2 Stable Core Go / No-Go

- [ ] OSS-01 and OSS-02 resolved; dependency/asset licenses and source provenance reviewed.
- [ ] Production money/cap/posting behavior exact; PostgreSQL concurrency tests pass.
- [ ] Single-institution boundary and object-level authorization verified.
- [ ] Institution can install without maintainers or demo seeding; unconfigured Circle stays read-only/simulated, never claims ready for payments.
- [ ] Complete zero-student Circle/Arc vendor-payment/reconciliation/export flow passes, with no AI and human release first.
- [ ] SMTP, MFA/recovery, private storage, import reconciliation and audit export verified.
- [ ] Backup/restore and previous-supported-version upgrade rehearsed within declared targets.
- [ ] Independent pilots approve workflows and documented limits; blockers resolved.
- [ ] Tagged artifacts trace to passing CI; preview cannot replace stable; docs/support owners named.
- [ ] Primary Circle/Arc live-rail gate passes; AI, Gateway/x402, escrow, off-ramp, Earn and Borrow remain disabled unless their own gates pass.

**Mandatory primary live-rail gate:** OSS-03/04/05 resolved; OSS-07 resolved wherever FX
is involved; institution/provider/legal approval recorded,
unknown-payment recovery tested, beneficiaries verified, restrictive limits and stop switch
proven, and successful real settlement reconciled. A green fake test suite alone never
satisfies this gate.

## 11. Next Work and Decisions Requiring Approval

**Next implementation batch:** Use Section 14's one-department college pilot as the
current product priority. Confirm the college's problem, consent, budget and source records;
finish required O0 checks and the remaining C1/C2 exact treasury, destination, reservation,
approval, submission/recovery and settlement-evidence gates. C0 already decouples the
institution operator from assistance; C1 draft/policy foundations are partial, not execution.
Prove each eligible staff-approved bill produces its linked testnet payment, then add the
opt-in capped recurring-payment lane. Keep existing working modules; broad inbound, student
aid, Gateway, x402, escrow, a generic ERP and a shared SaaS rewrite are not this batch.

Decisions to confirm before implementation:
1. Keep MIT and accept permissive forks/competing hosting, or seek a separately reviewed
   license change. Existing released MIT rights remain; no relicense in this planning change.
2. One institution per installation remains the proposed boundary. Institution-first,
   zero-student finance and Circle/Arc as primary settlement are confirmed product direction.
3. Hackathon wallet choice is settled: keep the current Circle Agent Wallet/Lepton path.
   Developer-Controlled Wallets may be reviewed after the hackathon. Obtain explicit testnet
   authorization, approved mirror-rate/rounding rules and controlled recipient mappings.
   Autonomous limits start at zero; staff may separately authorize only Section 14's capped
   testnet lane after its safety checks pass. Domestic payments remain separate.
4. Assign security/release/finance and college pilot owners; confirm one department, its
   bills, standing-policy limits and evidence/publication permissions with the interested
   college. Two independent institutions remain a later OSS O4 gate, not a hackathon prerequisite.
   Agree runtime, recovery and maintenance commitments from measured results.
5. Authorize credential remediation, seed safety changes and schema/payment refactoring
   as implementation work. This document does not execute those changes or transactions.
6. Decide the counterparty model before any inbound or live-vendor work (§15.9): whether
   aggregated collection is in scope at all, whether custodian/payout-partner settlement
   is in scope for any target jurisdiction, whether an institution-custodial ledger
   product is explicitly out of scope, and whether `Student.payout_address` is confirmed
   legacy. These decisions are what make OpenSinop a two-legged system or confirm it stays a
   one-way payment-mirroring tool.
7. Confirm the bounded autonomous lane framing and its dependency order (§18.8): a standing
   mandate decides the class of payment, deterministic PHP decides each occurrence, the model
   never authorises, the initial allowance is zero, and the executor chain (§18.7) precedes
   the mandate rather than running alongside it. Also confirm that retrospective agreement
   (§18.6) is acceptable hackathon evidence provided it is always labelled retrospective.

**Next implementation batch, concretely:** §17.3 — reviewed reservation release and funding
rollover, then durable outbox and attempt identity, then the isolated executor and Arc
settlement verification. Only after those does §18's mandate work become meaningful. Do not
start the mandate first; a lane that authorises payments it cannot execute is worse than no
lane, because the dashboard would report auto-authorized against money that never moves.

**Plan outcome:** Distribute an institution-owned Circle/Arc financial agent, not a
student-only demo. Keep one maintained codebase, configuration-driven policies, honest
capability limits and auditable USDC settlement. Self-hosted code does not remove Circle
service dependencies, custody duties or live-payment certification.

## 12. Circle/Arc-First Institution Financial Agent — Research and Build Plan

**Research date:** 2026-10-05. Official documentation and public sample source were read;
no wallet was provisioned/funded, no dependency installed and no transaction submitted.
Capabilities below are vendor-documented, not verified against this deployment. Mainnet
support does not certify OpenSinop or establish institution-specific service eligibility.

### 12.1 Responsibility Split and No-Student Baseline

Circle/Arc is the financial execution backbone; OpenSinop is the institution's orchestration
and control layer. Neither a wallet balance nor an LLM replaces accounting policy.

| Layer | Responsibility | Must not be mistaken for |
| --- | --- | --- |
| OpenSinop | Documents, institution permissions, budgets, approvals, reservations, bounded plans, postings and reconciliation | Unrestricted model authority or a complete ERP |
| Circle Agent Stack / Wallets | Signing and wallet operations, supported spending controls, provider screening | School procurement validation, universal KYB or complete institution compliance |
| Arc | USDC transfers, execution evidence and deterministic finality | Proof that the intended legal beneficiary delivered goods or owns an address |
| Gateway / App Kits | Explicit crosschain liquidity and payment capabilities | Automatic local-bank settlement or an unlimited delegated spending budget |
| x402 | Payment negotiation for paid HTTP resources | A requirement for ordinary vendor invoice payments |

```

**Existing legacy seam, not the background execution contract:** `OpenSinopAgent::runAutonomousCycle(Organization)` forecasts and processes
vendor `Invoice` rows before assistance. It is invoked by the developer command/dashboard,
not a safe scheduled departmental executor. Do not schedule this legacy float-based cycle
or reuse its assistance approval path to implement Sections 14.7–14.10. A `Student` is not required for that vendor path.
`SettlementOperatorFactory` previously required an assistance fund and policy. C0 now
builds an institution operator without them; active institution-scoped aid setup enables
those tools separately. No fake student or duplicate finance application is introduced.

**C0 implemented in part:** `opensinop:finance-preview` and `InspectInstitutionFinance`
use persisted installation identity, recorded treasury, Arc network checks and read-only
vendor reviews. CLI records `finance_previewed`, including `no_op` for no open bills.
No students, tuition accounts, aid fund/policy or AI provider required. The report always
has `can_execute=false`; legacy policy/forecast results are explicitly indicative. Native
18-decimal balances/residuals are exact strings and fake observations marked simulated.
Ambiguous identity, untrusted network/address or inexact monetary storage fails closed.
Paused aid approvals are refused before attribution if aid setup is unavailable.

**C1 draft foundation implemented in part:** `PrepareVendorPayment` and operator CLI
persist an exact full-bill `PaymentIntent` in `draft` state with stable UUID/provider
identity, canonical document/policy/destination digest and attributed audit. Identical
retry returns the same record; changed evidence or conflicting key is refused.
`VerifyVendorPaymentDraft` reloads current/stored documents and fails closed on drift or
integrity mismatch. Eligible staff may prepare/view; no actor may execute. DB uniqueness,
bounds and restrictive foreign keys protect basic identity/state and evidence; model
updates/deletes refused. Empty-table rollback is tested; populated-table rollback refuses
to erase evidence. Malformed snapshot shape is invalid, not an inferred approval. Canonical
hashes are independent of JSON object-key order and bind intent identity/original preparer.
No external call, reservation, approval or invoice change occurs.

**C1 reviewed policy foundation implemented:** exact six-decimal USDC reserve, auto/daily
limits and fee ceiling are stored as immutable `FinancePolicyVersion` content. Preparation
and append-only activation use separate maker/reviewer identities; super admins cannot
self-review. CLI preparation requires an explicit reserve with zero spending defaults;
activation requires explicit expected-current evidence (`none` only for initial activation).
Retries preserve original audit; policy replacement stales old drafts, never reapproves them.
Each activation binds predecessor digest and verifies actual policy content throughout the
recorded institution history, bounded at 10,000 entries and fail-closed beyond it. New drafts
require restrictive version/activation references and verified active evidence; no legacy
policy fallback. Existing drafts remain nullable/unapproved rather than guessed/backfilled.
Database guards reject negative/fractional/currency/cap violations; SQLite table alterations
restore monetary triggers. Empty rollback and retained-evidence refusal are tested.

Policy activation does not approve payments or change legacy execution paths. CLI staff IDs
are host-operator attribution, not personal authentication/MFA. Hashes are change detection,
not signatures; privileged DB rewrites with recomputed digests remain outside this guarantee.

**Reviewed beneficiary foundation delivered:** `VendorDestinationVersion` records institution,
vendor, recorded nonzero address, exact Arc chain identity and control-evidence reference.
Separate authenticated admin approval binds expected content/current approval, independent
verification reference and predecessor digest. Same retries preserve audit; self-review,
foreign/stale evidence, revoked vendors and corrupt predecessor history fail closed.
Approval is staff attestation of offchain verification, not cryptographic control proof or
payment authority. Native addresses alone are not proof; no gateway calls occur.

New drafts require current reviewed destination evidence and restrictive version/approval
references. A replacement approval stales existing drafts even if address stays the same.
Legacy vendor-address conflict is held for master-data review, never silently adopted.
Reviewed exact USDC `InvoiceVersion`/review evidence may bind a draft at full six-decimal
precision without reading legacy invoice floats. Local reference valuations remain
non-executable: no FX or real local-payable settlement inferred. Upgraded drafts retain
nullable evidence rather than fabricated approval; an intact legacy draft can now be retired
through reviewed recovery, while its replacement must bind current policy/destination evidence.
SQLite monetary guards are restored after additive FK changes; populated rollback refused.

**C1 draft recovery delivered:** immutable `PaymentIntentChange` proposals bind the original
draft ID/digest, attributed maker, UUID and reason. Replacement proposals additionally bind
an exact server-built current snapshot and fresh intent/provider identity. A separate
`PaymentIntentChangeReview` requires authenticated admin/super-admin role, exact proposal
digest and independence from both the original draft maker and proposal maker. Rejecting
leaves the original draft untouched. Accepting cancellation closes this document's draft
lineage; another UUID cannot reopen it. Accepting replacement atomically retires the source
and creates one immutable non-executable successor; it does not approve payment or reserve
funds. Original snapshots and feedback remain intact. Exact retries return recorded evidence,
including after later corrections, without reactivating old drafts or repeating audit events.

Document/revision uniqueness, unique predecessors/review links and unique accepted retirement
prevent duplicate roots, branching and conflicting accepted proposals. A bounded history
resolver validates every recorded proposal/review and contiguous successor link; cancelled,
superseded, incomplete or tampered history fails closed in preparation and verification.
Pending/rejected proposals never create a successor. Bills with any recorded legacy payment
outcome require investigation rather than draft cancellation or blind resend. Authenticated,
verified and throttled JSON endpoints are `finance.payment-intent-changes.*`; no staff-ID
approval CLI or dedicated shadow/demo domain is introduced. SQLite upgrade/rollback preserves
original digests and restores monetary guards; rollback refuses existing recovery evidence.
Staff recovery UI/import, invoice-source-version successors and safe recovery after reservation
or external submission remain separate work.

**C1 reviewed reservation release delivered:** `PaymentReservationRelease` and
`PaymentReservationReleaseReview` return held bill+capacity fee to a department without
ever editing the reservation or its cumulative chain. `ReservationCapacity` keeps two
totals deliberately apart: the historical chain total, which every hold recorded as
`prior_reserved_base_units` and which must reproduce exactly forever, and the consuming
total, which subtracts approved releases. Release is therefore an append-only fact rather
than a correction, so an auditor can still see the hold, its position in the sequence, who
took it and who ended it. Maker/checker applies twice over: neither the proposer nor the
staff member who took the hold may decide a release, and a hold with any authorization
decision is not releasable at all, because committed funds are not spare capacity and
release must not become an un-commit path. Decided releases are final, identical retries
return recorded evidence, and released capacity unblocks draft recovery. Release frees
capacity, never money: `payment_approved`, `external_funds_locked`, `can_execute` and
`local_accounts_changed` are all false, and the reservation chain is re-verified after an
approval so a release that would leave history unreproducible is refused. **Funding-window
rollover is delivered too** (see "Where Things Stand"), so an unattended lane can now renew
its evidence — provided the executor path below it is live.

**C1 bounded funding/reservation foundation delivered:** `FundingWindow` binds an existing
exact **USDC** `BudgetSnapshot`, its closed set of reviewed invoice versions, current finance
policy, Circle treasury identity and fresh block-bound Arc balance. `ArcBalanceObservation`
checks RPC chain identity and matching committed block hash, reads native USDC at that block,
and preserves 18-decimal quantities/residuals as arbitrary-precision strings. Native and
ERC-20 interfaces are not added together. RPC failures/malformed/stale quantities fail closed;
no legacy wallet float supplies exact funding. Balance reads are not settlement proof.

A separate verified admin approves expected window digest and attests allocation, disjoint
exclusions and exclusive treasury use; neither budget-evidence nor window maker can review.
Capacity is the lower of exact realized cash and observed Arc cash, after restricted cash,
other commitments and the higher of policy/snapshot reserve. Total bill **plus maximum fee**
consumes allocation and cash conservatively. `ReserveVendorPayment` rechecks current evidence
and a fresh balance before taking institution-serialized, uniquely identified immutable holds.
Cumulative arithmetic includes every prior hold; corrupt/missing intermediate evidence blocks
new capacity. Exact retries preserve original hold/audit and work without RPC availability.

**Deliberate initial limit:** one approved funding window per institution, for one department,
closed bill set and Circle wallet; maximum 15-minute observation window. No refresh, second
wallet/department window, automatic expiry release, or rollover can reset held capacity.
Expiry/drift blocks new holds while preserving previous holds. Reserved drafts cannot accept
cancellation/replacement until reviewed release exists. Preparation/review/reservation use
normal `finance.funding-windows.*` / `finance.payment-reservations.store` JSON workflows,
not a shadow/demo domain. Fake observations/holds carry explicit `is_fake`. Application
capacity hold is **not** a Circle wallet lock, payment approval, bank balance or statutory
posting. Outside wallet activity remains a risk requiring exclusive-use attestation and fresh
execution preflight later. No transfer, invoice-payment-state or legacy balance mutation occurs.
SQLite independent-worker contention is covered; PostgreSQL/provider production concurrency
and external withdrawal races remain uncertified. Empty rollback is supported; retained funding
or reservation evidence refuses destructive rollback.

**README scope alignment:** fee evidence now precedes planning; zero students remain required.
Local collection review is not treasury observation or FX. New funding windows require the
review-bound schema-v2 budget contract; legacy unbound receipts cannot be promoted. Review
UI/import and local-to-testnet authority remain immediate product gaps alongside safe release.

**Delivered:** reviewed reservation release and funding rollover. **Still proposed:**
multi-department shared
capacity, exact legacy treasury migration, selected account roles, MFA-backed payment approval,
outbox/attempt identity, settlement verification and posting. Draft/recovery/funding digest is
not payment approval, proof of ownership or a digital signature. Raw DB writes/admin access
are not covered by model immutability. SQLite float storage cannot recover exact values.

### 12.2 Wallet Ownership, Authorization and Operational Budget

Official Agent Wallet docs describe user-controlled **2-of-2 MPC**: key shares are not
exposed to the agent, users retain custody and Circle cannot unilaterally move funds.
Authentication creates a **28-day** session in the OS secure keychain, with independent
mainnet/testnet sessions. Documented native policies cover transfer caps and recipient/
contract lists; policy changes require a second email OTP and are **mainnet-only**.
Do not advertise testnet policy enforcement or blindly apply outdated seven-day notes.

**Current hackathon pilot:** keep the existing Circle Agent Wallet/Lepton path; do not
switch wallet models mid-hackathon. Use an approved operator, recovery process and limited
faucet-funded `ARC-TESTNET` allowance. Check CLI/session/network compatibility, expiry,
limits and keychain operation in the deployment container. Testnet application caps remain
mandatory; do not claim Circle's mainnet-only native policies enforce the pilot.
**Later server treasury alternative:** Developer-Controlled Wallets are designed for backend
operations; the treasury sample uses this model. Their API key/entity-secret authorization
is a separate post-hackathon integration/review, not an Agent Wallet session or an automatic multisig.

The agent must not have access to the institution mailbox, OTPs, private keys, entity
secret or unrestricted shell. Only the isolated executor receives signing authority.
Never fund an automated operational wallet with the entire unrestricted treasury.
Reserve custody/recovery remains under institution control; replenishment requires
approved policy and human review initially. Independent OpenSinop limits remain mandatory.

Each treasury account records provider/account identifier, address, network, account type,
role, ownership approval and readiness state. Roles distinguish reserve, operational and
Gateway-deposited funds. Departmental envelopes can be ledger allocations; they do not
require a wallet per student or department. Agent CLI wallet-count limits and deployment
costs must be verified before promising mass provisioning.

**Counterparty addresses are not treasury accounts.** Section 15 is the authoritative
statement of who holds a student or vendor address, the five wallet roles, the
destination-type discriminator and why an institution wallet cannot stand in for a
counterparty one. Nothing in this section authorises the institution to custody a student's
or a vendor's funds, and no counterparty wallet provisioning exists in the installed
gateway contract.

### 12.3 Arc Integration Rules That Change the Implementation

| Concern | Verified documentation | OpenSinop requirement |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Networks | Mainnet chain ID `5042`; testnet `5042002`; USDC gas | Pin environment/chain/provider; verify RPC chain ID; never silent mainnet fallback |
| Precision | Native USDC 18 decimals; ERC-20 interface 6; one underlying balance | Payment units stay 6; preserve 18-decimal native balance/gas/residual strings; no floats or double-counted balances |
| Events | System emitter `0xffffFFFfFFffffffffffffffFfFFFfffFFFfFFfE` logs native/explicit USDC movement; ERC-20 emitter `0x3600000000000000000000000000000000000000` also logs ERC-20 transfers | Index canonical system events at 18 decimals or use an explicitly deduplicated strategy; do not add paired event streams |
| Finality | Final on inclusion in a committed block; included execution may still revert | Require successful receipt and matching economic movement, not hash or block number alone |
| Gas | USDC gas; documented `maxFeePerGas` minimum 20 Gwei | Estimate/cap fees, reserve gas, distinguish sponsored fees; unsupported/dropped/pending stays unresolved |
| Memos | Predeployed Memo wrapper preserves EOA sender; not a universal transaction memo field | Use opaque payment reference with verified Memo event/calldata association; direct EOA compatibility required |
| Batches | `Multicall3From` preserves EOA sender; `allowFailure` controls per-call failure | Future adapter must verify each intended transfer; successful batch hash alone cannot settle every payable |

Native gas fees are not Transfer events; derive actual fees from receipts and reconcile
fee sponsorship separately. Block timestamps can repeat; checkpoint by block/log position,
not timestamp alone. Use an RPC/indexer with required method/history support; the Lepton
proxy's `rpc()` method does not guarantee every RPC method is allowlisted.

Arc Foundry is the documented Arc-specific local testing/deployment tool. Use it for
future contracts rather than claiming standard Anvil simulates every Arc behavior. Review
contract addresses and supported wallet type against current official docs for each chain.

### 12.4 Three Distinct Money Flows

**A. Direct institutional USDC payments — first delivery**
- Vendor invoices, approved subscriptions, reimbursements, refunds and student grants.
- Create document-linked payment intent with source account, verified beneficiary,
  network/asset, exact amount, purpose, due date, approved policy and fee ceiling.
- Reserve once, approve when required, submit through Circle, verify Arc and post once.
- Payroll calculations/tax filings remain in existing payroll systems; import approved
  obligations only where recipient and jurisdiction permit the chosen settlement asset.

**B. Gateway / App Kits — crosschain treasury liquidity**
- Gateway forms a unified balance from deposits finalized and processed on source chains.
  Wallet funds, pending deposits, spendable Gateway balance and pending destination funds
  are separate buckets. A deposit/bridge is asset movement, not fresh institutional income.
- Deposit only through supported Gateway deposit methods. A normal ERC-20 transfer to
  the Gateway Wallet contract does not create a deposit and can lose the funds.
- Delegates have full allowance over authorized deposited balance, not a departmental
  spending cap. Do not delegate the main reserve to an unrestricted agent. Removing a
  delegate does not cancel already-signed burn intents before their expiry.
- Record source/destination chain, transfer ID/spec hash, attestation/expiry, source burn,
  destination mint, fees and recovery state. No duplicate bridging after an uncertain call.
- Recovery includes Gateway's documented seven-day trustless withdrawal path. That delay
  is not the Agent Wallet session lifetime and is not an instant cash reserve.

**C. x402 / Gateway Nanopayments — bounded paid services**
- Agent may buy approved FX data, document OCR or other HTTP services; x402 negotiates
  price and payment after HTTP `402`. It does not replace payables/document accounting.
- Direct facilitator settlement and Gateway batching are separate x402 mechanisms. The
  latter requires prefunded Gateway balance and compatible seller support.
- Persist request identity, seller/network/asset, quoted maximum, authorization nonce,
  expiry and provider transfer/settlement ID before retry. Restrict hosts, methods,
  redirects/egress and approved service catalog; model-supplied URLs are untrusted.
- Set per-call `maxAmount`, total daily/monthly API budgets and concurrency caps. A small
  per-call ceiling alone does not prevent cumulative wallet drainage.
- Gateway acceptance can serve a resource before batch settlement. Maintain accepted,
  pending and completed states; a batch transaction can include unrelated applications
  and many transfers. Never deduplicate these payments by batch hash alone.

### 12.5 Inbound Collection and Institution Payment Orchestration

Receivables may belong to a sponsor, donor, external organization or student. Student
identity is optional; institution ownership, business document and payment reference are
not. Use collection intent/payment link with opaque reference, permitted asset/network,
amount/expiry and institution-controlled destination.

1. Ingest verified Circle notifications and Arc observations into a durable inbox. Verify
   raw-body signatures before processing; deduplicate events and support replay/backfill.
2. Verify network, successful movement, destination ownership, asset, amount and finality.
   Sender address alone does not identify a student/vendor; relayer and economic sender
   can differ. Wallet balance increases without attributable evidence do not close invoices.
3. Allocate only from a bound collection/provider reference or verified compatible memo
   plus matching transfer. Reference is correlation, not authorization. Handle partial,
   excess, duplicate, expired and wrong-asset payments explicitly.
4. Ambiguous payments enter an **unallocated/suspense ledger**, with suggested matches for
   staff review. This is accounting classification, not smart-contract escrow. Fuzzy or
   LLM matches cannot automatically mark a receivable paid.
5. Issue receipt and document-linked postings once after verified allocation. Refunds
   create a separately approved outbound intent; never trust an unverified return address.

Do not assume unlimited per-invoice wallets, automatic bank VANs or a memo on every direct
send. Onramp Kit is a separate capability for acquiring stablecoins; local-bank off-ramp
availability requires another approved provider. Neither is proved by USDC transfer alone.

**Payer identity is not student identity.** Section 15.6 records why the student/payer
relationship must be explicit before inbound work begins: the party that owns the funds is
frequently not the beneficiary of the education, `Student.payout_address` attributes funds
to the wrong side of that relationship, and inbound models differ so widely in cost and
attribution (staff-recorded, custodial credit, aggregated collection, payer self-custody)
that the choice belongs in the plan rather than in an implementation.

### 12.6 Durable Institution Cycle and Accounting Controls

Proposed `opensinop:financial-cycle` dispatches durable work; it is not claimed to exist.
Use Laravel scheduler and queue workers, not an indefinite request or Octane callback.
Use overlap/single-server controls with shared lock store, plus authoritative DB unique
intent identities. Queue uniqueness is not external exactly-once payment safety.

1. **Observe/reconcile:** Refresh wallet/Gateway observations and process inbox; complete
   verification of prior attempts before proposing more payments. Preserve unknown states.
2. **Forecast:** Compute current unrestricted spendable funds by bucket/currency, committed
   reservations, gas/fee allowance, approved obligations and protected reserves. Do not
   count unpaid receivables, pending deposits or restricted endowments as spendable cash.
3. **Plan:** Deterministically prioritize due/authorized obligations; optional model can
   explain or suggest a plan but cannot invent documents, recipients or funding sources.
4. **Authorize/reserve:** Apply immutable institutional policy, verified vendor master,
   budget, reserve/daily limits and maker/checker controls. Bind approval to a digest of
   material fields; amount/address/chain/policy changes invalidate previous authority.
5. **Execute:** Outbox worker loads the authorized intent, rechecks readiness/stop switch,
   fees and policy, and submits with stable provider identity. Auto portion, remainder,
   refund and separate instalments require distinct intent IDs—not one ticket-based key.
6. **Verify/post:** Match rail-specific settlement and append balanced document-linked
   postings, fees and allocation evidence. Provider success plus DB failure recovers the
   same payment; unknown results cannot release funds or cause another transfer.

**Accounting defenses:** Three-way match for applicable procurement (purchase order,
receipt and invoice); vendor destination change approval and cooling-off policy; duplicate
invoice detection; restricted funds; period close/lock; reversals and FX/dust entries with
explicit evidence. Balanced debit/credit arithmetic alone cannot detect a wrong payee or
fictional invoice. Chain proof verifies movement, not the business entitlement.

Reserve floor, payroll commitments and due-date priority are institution policy, not
universal hardcoded rules. Unspent departmental/grant money must not be swept automatically
unless funding restrictions, fiscal closure and authorized policy allow it. Earn/Borrow or
FX rebalancing of reserves requires separate risk approval; default is observation/advice.

### 12.7 Installed Bridge Coverage and Data Model

Installed `yukazakiri/lepton-agent` **2.6.0** contracts were inspected:

| Existing contract | Available methods | Missing from that contract |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `WalletGateway` | `transfer`, `balance`, `transactions`, `limits` | Wallet provisioning, arbitrary signing/contract execution, budget reservation |
| `ArcNetworkGateway` | Network/explorer helpers and read `rpc` | Guaranteed RPC allowlist/history support, a settlement predicate |
| `AuthGateway` | Session inspection and human-assisted OTP flow | Institutional roles, unattended credential renewal |
| `X402Gateway` | `searchServices`, `inspectService`, `payService`, `gatewayBalance` | Full Gateway deposit/delegate/withdrawal/transfer lifecycle API |

`executePaymentBaseUnits()` is only an entry-point improvement: current wallet/model
floats and two-decimal transaction columns still lose precision. Current immediate
`CONFIRMED` and hash-only reconciliation remain live-payment blockers. Ticket-based
idempotency does not distinguish assistance auto portion from human remainder.

Reuse Laravel actions/models, `InstallationInstitution`, `Money`, finance policy and
forecast services. Partial foundations already shipped: read-only Arc observations,
immutable `FinancePolicyVersion` content/activation and document-bound vendor
`PaymentIntent` drafts (Section 12.1). These do not provide payment authority or execution.
Remaining proposed records/lifecycle work:
- Destination suspension/revocation lifecycle, cooling-off and independent control evidence certification beyond shipped versioned staff approval.
- Durable treasury account observations with network/provider, balance bucket, units/precision
  and freshness; reporting values must not overwrite actual asset balances.
- Receivable collection intents, executable payment-intent lifecycle and attempt records.
- Unique reservation, approval-digest, outbox/inbox and allocation/posting records.
- Gateway transfer/deposit evidence and x402 request/nonce/provider-transfer records,
  with nonunique batch-hash links and distinct settlement states.

Each record carries institution ownership and authoritative document/intent identity.
Avoid polymorphic unvalidated IDs as permission bypasses. Retain evidence through deletion
or archival; financial history must not disappear via cascading model deletes.

App Kits are TypeScript SDKs; `@circle-fin/app-kit` is **not installed** here. If required
capability is absent in Lepton, propose an explicit adapter extension or isolated TS worker
using the documented Circle Wallets adapter. Worker accepts allowlisted authorized intents,
not arbitrary calldata or shell from the model. Pin/test SDK and chain compatibility;
package/architecture additions require approval. Do not invent PHP methods for TS SDKs.

### 12.8 Reference Apps: Borrow Patterns, Not Production Guarantees

| Supplied resource | Verified material | Safe use in OpenSinop |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `circlefin/arc-fintech` | Next.js/Supabase treasury, Developer-Controlled Wallets, App Kit Send/Bridge/Swap, Gateway balances and notifications; testnet sample, Earn rewards mocked; Apache-2.0 | Wallet/available-balance separation, estimate-before-send, provider IDs and webhook-driven updates; port domain patterns, not framework/security assumptions |
| `circlefin/arc-escrow` | Arc testnet escrow with Circle contract execution; `validate-work` releases after LLM `valid`/`HIGH`; Apache-2.0 | Study escrow/refund lifecycle only. Never use model confidence as institutional release authority; use approved evidence, authorization and audited contract conditions |
| `the-canteen-dev/circle-agent` | Working testnet x402/Gateway trace, settlement UUID then batch; hardcoded demo snapshots and timestamp/amount heuristics | UX explaining wallet vs Gateway funds and pending vs completed. Heuristic batch pairing is not unique settlement proof; license not established by reviewed README |
| `circlefin/arc-x402-circle-wallets` | At review time repo contains README only, describing autonomous x402 with a developer-controlled wallet | Concept reference only; no runnable integration/code or production proof to copy |
| Canteen “Agents and Ledgers” | Editorial source analysis of nine ledgers and agent boundaries | Document provenance, three-way matching, visible repair, shared validation path and idempotency. Specific third-party findings need independent verification before adoption |

Apache-2.0 code reuse requires license/notice review; OpenSinop's MIT does not override it.
None of these testnet samples proves institution eligibility, statutory accounting,
production custody, security audit or an end-to-end regional fiat off-ramp.

### 12.9 Ordered Delivery and Acceptance

| Stage | Deliverable | Gate before next stage |
| --- | --- | --- |
| C0 — Institution context (read-only slice implemented) | Aid-independent operator/factory, finance-preview CLI, Arc observation and indicative vendor review | Zero-student/no-aid tests, read-only/replay/network/precision/ownership checks and audited no-op pass; immutable finance policy and payment authority remain C1 work |
| C1 — Safe direct USDC (non-executable draft and reviewed policy foundation implemented) | Exact draft/snapshot/retry identity, immutable policy versions, separate activation, reviewed vendor destinations and exact USDC invoice evidence binding now; legacy migration, destination revocation/cooling-off, reservation/payment-approval/outbox/attempts, Arc verification and postings remain open | Draft/replay/staleness/ownership/DB-bounds/history/CLI tests pass on SQLite; PostgreSQL races/upgrades/recovery, authenticated privileged review and live settlement gates still required |
| C2 — Circle operations | Chosen account model, policy coverage, recovery, expiry/keychain checks and stop switch | Capped testnet proof then separately authorized institution live certification; no unattended mainnet assumption |
| C3 — Referenced collections | Circle/Arc inbox, USDC collection intents, deterministic allocations and suspense queue | Duplicate/partial/extra/native-vs-ERC20/replay cases pass without students |
| C4 — Crosschain and paid APIs | Gateway lifecycle/fees/recovery plus allowlisted x402 service spend | Transfer ID/nonce dedup, batch evidence, expiry/delegation and daily spend ceilings proven |
| C5 — Wider finance modules | Procurement escrow, refunds, subscriptions and aid through same shared intent engine | Human-approved business evidence and module-specific acceptance; no model-only escrow release |

Current first demonstration follows Section 14: one college department, its approved budget
and anonymized bills; staff-verified opening funds or aggregate realized fee receipts; policy
reasoning, holds and human review; each eligible approval connected to an actual Circle Agent
Wallet payment and verified Arc **testnet** evidence. Fake runs are development checks, not
payment-flow evidence. Add the separately authorized capped recurring-payment lane after the
human path passes. Repeat without paying again. Entire pilot must run with **zero students**;
a student collection portal and C3 inbound automation are not prerequisites.

**Production limits:** Circle screening is not complete KYB, beneficiary verification or
regulatory certification. Obtain institution/product/jurisdiction approval and establish
fund ownership/recovery before live use. Public-chain identifiers/amounts are linkable;
keep student names, IDs, private documents and hardship text offchain. Do not auto-invest
payroll/restricted reserves through Earn/Borrow because the SDK makes it possible.

## 13. School-Wide Finance Events, Feasibility and Measurable Value

### 13.1 Recommendation and What Has Been Verified

**Recommendation: proceed as institution-owned finance orchestration, not an unrestricted
AI treasurer or a replacement for the school's ERP, procurement staff or governing board.**
Student requests are one event source. Institutional operations, funding conditions,
contracts and payment exceptions are equally important sources.

**Technical feasibility checked on 2026-10-06:** Circle's official
[Developer-Controlled Wallet documentation](https://developers.circle.com/wallets/dev-controlled)
explicitly supports treasury management and scheduled/event-driven payouts, while requiring
application-owned policies and approvals. [Agent Wallets](https://developers.circle.com/agent-stack/agent-wallets)
provide bounded wallet operations; [Arc's transaction lifecycle](https://docs.arc.network/integrate/wallets/transaction-lifecycle)
provides execution/finality evidence. None of these products knows which school invoice,
purchase, grant condition or academic service justifies a payment.

**Repository evidence:** C0 tests exercise institution treasury observation and vendor-policy
review without students, aid funds or aid policies. Reviews cover holds, escalation, budget
failure, invalid destinations, institution/network mismatch and replay without payment.
This verifies a read-only foundation, not institution-wide live execution. C1 now adds bounded,
reviewed USDC funding and cumulative capacity holds for one closed department bill set.
Receipt verification, exact legacy treasury migration, durable submission/recovery are still
required.

**Benefit verification is separate:** The owner reports a local college agreed to explore
OpenSinop, with concern about AI handling money. This is an interested pilot partner, not a
completed deployment, adoption metric or public endorsement. No completed college pilot,
measured savings, improved retention or lower outage rate is claimed. Section 14 defines the
current shadow/testnet pilot; wider benefits below remain hypotheses with observable measures.
A passing test suite cannot prove adoption, provider eligibility, compliance or financial return.

| Decision | Recommended scope | Boundary |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Observe and explain | Due documents, stored commitments, verified balance observations, exceptions and evidence-linked summaries | State freshness, missing data and indicative results; never infer funds from forecast revenue |
| Prepare and route | Draft payment plans, reminders, exception cases and human approval packages | Human-owned policy, beneficiary master and permitted event sources; model cannot invent obligations |
| Execute bounded payments | Existing approved obligation, verified destination, allowed USDC rail, reserved budget and current authority | Only after C1/C2; zero autonomous allowance initially; revalidate material changes and stop switch |
| Change school policy or business entitlement | Procurement award, fee waiver, grant reallocation, payroll approval, borrowing or investment | Accountable staff/board decision; no model-only release or silent policy override |

### 13.2 Operational Use-Case Catalog

All event-specific modules below are **proposed** unless the status column says C0 review.
A generic `Invoice` can represent an approved bill today; it does not implement the named
business process, document checks, reminders, commitments or beneficiary verification.

| Event / difficulty | Proposed agent response and required evidence | Authority limit / dependencies | School-wide benefit to test | Status / acceptance signal |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Learning-platform or internet renewal approaching expiry** | Read approved contract, service dates, renewal bill and departmental budget; flag deadline, prepare payment and request IT confirmation | Cannot renew unwanted services, accept price changes or assume supplier accepts USDC; C1/C2 execution, contract/deadline module | Keep teaching systems available; IT and teachers see funding/release blockers before expiry | C0 can review imported bill; later measure finance-caused service interruptions and proportion reviewed before cutoff |
| **Laboratory supplies or cafeteria replenishment** | Match purchase order, received quantities and invoice; detect duplicate bill; reserve approved allocation before release | Procurement confirms goods/quality; no duplicate payment or unreceived-goods release; supplier/local-ramp eligibility required | Reduce lesson or meal disruption caused by finance delay, not promise to solve inventory shortages | Bill review only today; later measure approved orders paid on time, stockout cause and unmatched delivery exceptions |
| **Emergency generator, water-system or storm-damage repair** | Link authorized facilities incident, quote and emergency budget; show cash impact and route expedited review | Emergency priority never bypasses reserve, verified recipient or maker/checker checks; repair necessity stays with facilities owner | Faster accountable response and fewer facility-related class cancellations attributable to funding delay | Urgency routing not shipped; measure incident-to-finance-decision time separately from vendor repair time |
| **Term-start collection rush and unidentified receipts** | Match verified incoming payment to bound collection reference; handle partial/excess amounts and queue uncertain allocations | No fuzzy/LLM auto-match; cashier reviews suspense cases; admission/enrollment eligibility remains SIS-owned; C3 | Less cashier rework and fewer incorrect unpaid flags for families; faster reliable registration processing | C3 planned; measure unmatched-receipt age, manual corrections and time from verified receipt to correct allocation |
| **Payroll deadline with delayed tuition or sponsor income** | Compare approved payroll obligations, actual unrestricted cash, commitments and forecast scenarios; hold discretionary releases and alert finance leadership | Do not count promised income as available; do not calculate payroll/taxes, borrow, liquidate reserves or pay staff in USDC without approved lawful arrangement | Earlier warning before operational disruption; leadership receives concrete choices rather than an unexplained low balance | C0 stored-ledger forecast only; restricted-cash/commitment model planned; measure warning lead time and forecast error |
| **Restricted research grant or donor-funded equipment** | Record award/donation conditions, permitted categories, milestones and separate fund allocation; block incompatible spending | No end-of-term sweep to general funds unless donor/legal conditions permit; research/grants owner validates use; restricted-fund module | Protect research delivery and donor trust; reduce questioned expenditure and repayment risk | Not shipped; acceptance requires prohibited-category and overcommitment tests plus fund-owner sign-off |
| **Field trip, tournament or graduation event deposits** | Link approved event budget, supplier contract, due instalments, participant collections and cancellation/refund terms; track total exposure | Never create travel commitments, substitute vendors or approve safety decisions; cumulative instalments need distinct intent identities | Avoid preventable event cancellation and explain outstanding costs to event owners | Generic bill review only; later measure deposit timeliness, budget overruns and refund exceptions per event |
| **Duplicate payment, course cancellation or dorm-deposit refund** | Verify original receipt, refund entitlement/credit note, previously refunded totals and return beneficiary; create separate refund intent | No new destination from an email/model; no refund beyond eligible received amount; admissions/housing approves entitlement; C3/C5 | Faster, traceable resolution for parents/students and fewer disputes | Refund workflow not certified; measure refund completion time, repeated refunds and disputed balances |
| **Vendor payout-address change or suspected duplicate invoice** | Compare approved vendor destination version and invoice identifiers; pause affected intent and route independent verification | A PDF, message or valid address syntax cannot update trusted destination; CFO/procurement confirm change outside the requester's channel | Protect school operating funds and preserve trusted supplier relationships | Versioned separate destination review and draft binding delivered; cryptographic/control certification, duplicate detection and cooling-off still planned |
| **Overlapping departmental purchases near term end** | Aggregate commitments, pending approvals and reservations across departments; show affordable options and blocked obligations | Never treat independently passing invoices as a cumulatively funded plan; staff approves trade-offs; C1 atomic reservations | Fewer last-minute cancellations and fairer, visible resource allocation to teaching departments | C0 independent reviews only; require concurrent-overcommitment tests and measure planned-versus-real spending |

Student hardship and scholarships remain supported module targets, but are not the trigger
for starting the institution agent. School operations, staff, parents, donors and students
benefit through different workflows; do not measure success only by number of aid requests.

### 13.3 Event Handling Without Turning Every Signal Into a Payment

Proposed workflow reuses Section 12's document-linked intent engine:

1. Capture an event from an authenticated institution action, imported approved document,
   due-date schedule or verified provider notification. Record institution, source event ID,
   document identity, owner, occurred/received times and applicable policy version.
2. Validate source/provenance, ownership, current document state and required business
   evidence. Webhooks and schedules may repeat or arrive out of order; deduplicate identity
   and recheck current state rather than blindly repeating an action.
3. Classify the response: informational alert, request for missing evidence, human exception
   review, proposed payment intent, or no-op. LLM interpretation is a suggestion; deterministic
   rules determine whether a proposed financial action is even permitted.
4. Show the accountable owner a package containing deadline, affected school service,
   exact amount, funding restrictions, relevant commitments, balance freshness and failed
   checks. Unknown or inconsistent evidence produces an explicit unresolved case.
5. Route a permitted financial action through C1 reservation and approval controls, then
   C2 Circle submission and Arc verification. Reminders, incident triage and document matching
   must not invoke a transfer merely because an event is called urgent.
6. Close the case only with appropriate evidence. A settled payment closes payment execution,
   not goods delivery, repair completion, enrollment approval or legal dispute resolution.

The main agent coordinates institution-owned work queues; no extra AI agent is required
per department. Humans remain accountable for business decisions. Read-only dashboards
can serve directors and department heads with role-scoped data; salary, personal hardship
and donor-sensitive information must not become broadly visible.

### 13.4 Concrete Walkthroughs and Failure Cases

**Class continuity under competing bills — hypothetical C1 example, not defaults:**
Treasury has `500.000000 USDC`, protected reserve `100.000000`, existing commitments
`350.000000` and fee allowance `5.000000`, leaving `45.000000` available. An approved LMS
bill for `25.000000` and facilities bill for `30.000000` cannot both be released. Once one
is reserved, the other requires a funding/trade-off decision. The agent shows affected
services, deadlines and alternatives; it cannot raid reserves, assume a tuition payment
will arrive, or let two workers reserve the same money. The school—not the model—chooses
which service obligation takes priority under approved policy. Reserve and commitment
figures must not overlap; C1 defines those accounting semantics explicitly.

**Grant-funded laboratory purchase:** A donor receipt is verified but restricted to lab
hardware. A lab supplier bill can be proposed against that fund after order/receipt checks;
a cafeteria bill cannot. Moving USDC successfully would not make the cafeteria spending
permitted. A spending hold protects the school and donor conditions, while the research
owner decides amendments through a recorded approval—not a model confidence score.

**Enrollment payment exception:** A parent pays the correct amount but supplies an invalid
reference. The collection is recorded as verified but unallocated; cashier receives a case
with candidate documents. No guessed allocation, automatic enrolment denial, late penalty
or hold on essential education services follows. After authorized matching, receipt and
SIS/accounting allocation are updated once; duplicate webhook replay cannot allocate again.
This illustrates C3 work, not an existing C0 collection feature.

### 13.5 Where Circle/Arc Fits—and When Not to Use It

Circle/Arc remains the primary programmable USDC rail. Its strongest fit is an institution
and counterparties approved to hold/receive USDC, especially when a real settlement or
crosschain liquidity need exists. End-to-end benefit depends on approved recipients,
funding, FX/ramp availability, support/recovery and local requirements—not chain speed alone.

Do **not** force parents, staff, domestic utility providers or public-sector suppliers into
stablecoins to satisfy the architecture. If they require local bank money, an approved
regional conversion/payout provider is necessary. No reviewed docs or code prove universal
bank coverage, lower total fees or permissible USDC payroll. Compare complete round-trip
cost and timing: acquisition, spreads, network/provider fees, payout, reconciliation and
operator effort, against the institution's existing route.

Not recommended:
- Model-only procurement awards, payroll approval, tuition penalties/waivers, fee changes,
  grant reallocations, investments or borrowing.
- Autonomous emergency overrides, arbitrary contract calls, unrestricted service purchases,
  or wallet-session/email access by a model.
- Replacing statutory accounting/SIS/payroll before data, controls and jurisdiction-specific
  workflows are independently validated.
- Live use of legacy execution just because C0 tests pass; float storage, intent/recovery
  and settlement-evidence gaps still block production financial authority.

**If USDC is not suitable for the pilot institution:** retain Circle/Arc in an isolated
simulated/testnet evaluation and keep production finance observation/review read-only.
Integrate approved obligations/reconciliation with the existing accounting/bank workflow;
a future reviewed local-bank export/adapter can serve it. This is a fallback operating
recommendation, not a claim that such an adapter ships today. Do not enable live money
movement until the institution approves a viable end-to-end rail.

Section 15.5 turns this from a caution into a design constraint: because most domestic
vendors will need a `custodian_account` or `payout_partner_account` rather than a
self-custody address, the **settlement predicate itself becomes type-specific**. An
on-chain receipt closes a self-custody destination and cannot close a custodian or payout
one, so a "verified on Arc" label is only meaningful for the destination type that
produced it.

### 13.6 Pilot That Proves Value Beyond Bookkeeping

Current hackathon scope is **fee collections and budget planning in shadow/parallel mode**,
narrowed to one department's approved budget and bills, as specified in Section 14. Staff-verified
aggregate receipts/opening funds can feed planning without student records or a collection
integration. Deliver the remaining C1/C2 lifecycle next: every eligible admin-approved item
must produce its linked, verified testnet payment; an unrelated transfer does not prove the
workflow. Then add the separately approved capped recurring-payment lane. Confirm value with
the college, expand departments first, and add C3 collections and later assistance only after
validation. The wider catalog is not a requirement to build all modules before the pilot.

Pilot sequence:
1. Record baseline for one institution's approved vendor bills, critical-service deadlines,
   manual review effort, exception age and current all-in payment cost. Agree case definitions
   with bursar, IT/facilities and academic operations; do not invent improvement percentages.
2. Start with C0 read-only reviews. Staff compares recommendations with authoritative records
   and policy. Log false holds, false approvals, missing data and useful alerts. C0 alone is
   not the organizer's payment-flow deliverable.
3. Resolve C1/C2 gates; test duplicate, crash, unknown outcome, reserve drift and restore
   cases. Obtain explicit testnet authorization and link each eligible approved bill to its
   exact USDC mirror payment. Real-money trials remain a separate post-hackathon decision.
4. Keep testnet release human-approved initially. Introduce an opt-in capped lane only for
   existing approved recurring obligations after all budget/destination/recovery/evidence
   checks pass. Policy failures stay blocked; a human cannot approve past a hard limit.
5. Compare approve-as-is versus edited/rejected proposals and review time against baseline;
   report automatic/escalated/held outcomes separately. Capture college-authorized video of
   staff using the workflow, collaboration proof and linked testnet/audit evidence. Publish
   only with consent and expand only when college owners confirm useful results.

| Owner / beneficiary | Evidence to collect | Acceptance / stop condition |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Accounting/cashier | Manual touches per correctly reconciled payment, correction rate and unresolved receipt/refund age | Exact reconciliation and no fabricated/duplicate posting; pause when unexplained balances persist |
| IT/facilities/academic operations | Finance-attributable service interruptions, deadline review coverage and incident-to-finance-decision time | Demonstrable useful warning/routing; do not blame unrelated stock/repair delays on finance |
| Department/research leaders | Approved commitments versus available allocation, prohibited-fund use and blocked overcommitments | Restricted spending never bypassed; no silent reallocation or reserve double-counting |
| Institution leadership | Forecast error/alert lead time, exception backlog, all-in cost, staff workload and recovery results | Improvement against agreed baseline without weakened controls; stop if burden/cost outweighs benefit |
| Families/students/vendors | Correct allocation/receipt or refund time, disputes and on-time approved payments | No automatic adverse school decisions from uncertain payment data; protect privacy and recipient choice |

Absolute live-pilot stop conditions: unauthorized release, duplicate charge, beneficiary
mismatch, breached reservation/reserve boundary, lost approval evidence, unresolved signing
ownership, or missing trustworthy settlement proof. Freeze new submissions while preserving
in-flight reconciliation and investigation. A benefit claim requires measured school
results; technical feasibility alone is not proof of adoption or financial value.

## 14. College Shadow Pilot — Hackathon Execution Contract

### 14.1 Decision, Authority and Current Status

**Source:** Organizer Aljosa [Arc]'s feedback supplied by the owner: focus on one workflow,
prefer fee collections and budget planning in shadow/parallel mode, start with one department,
connect approved items to actual Arc testnet payments, include a small capped autonomous
lane, collect real-user evidence and keep Circle Agent Wallets for the hackathon.
This is product guidance, not a waiver of safety gates, official judging rules, guaranteed
endorsement or a promise of social promotion.

**Pilot partner status:** The owner reports one local college said yes to exploring OpenSinop.
The college remains skeptical of AI handling institutional funds. Department, primary pain
point, authorized finance owner, records, limits and publication permissions still require
confirmation. Do not describe this as a completed pilot or production adoption.

**Scope precedence for implementation agents:** This section governs current hackathon
priorities when older student-aid demos or the broader OSS roadmap suggest different work.
Sections 8–10 still govern financial safety and production release. The user college decides
which useful, feasible problem to validate; organizer preference does not replace discovery.

| State | What exists or is required | What it does not prove |
| --- | --- | --- |
| C0 foundation | Read-only institution observation, indicative vendor review and audited no-op; no student/aid/AI requirement | `can_execute=false`; not an approved-payment pilot |
| C1 foundation, partial | Independently reviewed aggregate collections bound to local departmental plans; exact non-executable vendor drafts, reviewed cancellation/replacement, immutable policy activation, invoice evidence, reviewed USDC funding window and cumulative bill/fee holds | No payment approval, external wallet lock, safe execution or settlement certification |
| Current delivery target | Departmental source records, policy-linked proposals, authenticated staff review, each eligible approval's actual testnet payment, verified evidence and capped automation | Target is not shipped by this documentation update |
| Later institution release | Exact legacy migration, production concurrency/recovery and full operational/provider/jurisdiction gates | Testnet success does not authorize mainnet, college treasury custody or local-bank payments |

**Application boundary:** shadow pilot names the demo practice only. Reuse normal invoice,
budget, review and payment-intent workflows; do not add a dedicated shadow feature or
parallel finance domain. Testnet execution is separately configured and authorized.

### 14.2 One Workflow, One Department

**Product wedge:** reconciled fees already collected, then background proposals for their
permitted use under finance supervision. **Two intake lanes now exist in scope:** the college's
current cash/bank process with cashier-reviewed records, and the optional direct student-wallet
UI merged in PR #14. The latter is not yet a safe source of planning cash; §14.10 gates its
integration on durable intent, matching settlement proof and reconciled attribution. College
staff still decides which real channels are approved; a demo UI does not authorize real tuition
collection. A student-uploaded receipt, pending transfer or expected payment is not cash.
Agent proposes which existing approved obligations fit available cash and allocation, not
new percentage splits, fee policies or interdepartmental transfers. Assistance stays deferred;
no student record or assistance request starts this loop.

**First executable slice:** one
college department, its already-approved budget and approved vendor/service bills due over
the next couple of weeks. Use the college's most important feasible problem, confirmed by
its finance owner. Do not begin with a generalized agent handling every inflow/outflow.

Minimum inputs, supplied or confirmed by authorized staff:
- Department and budget period, approved allocation, already-spent/committed amounts and
  any restricted funds or protected reserves. Budget allocation is not proof of cash.
- Staff-verified aggregate realized fee receipts or approved opening funds, with source/date
  evidence. Aggregate source stream/reference, nonoverlapping collection interval, source-document
  digest, exact original currency/received amount, restrictions and independent review bind
  receipts to a plan. Opening funds must exclude the same receipts. Expected tuition, promised
  grants and forecast revenue are not available funds. An optional portal receipt must bind
  its payer/account, network/asset, exact transfer movement and allocation/restrictions before
  entering the same reviewed evidence path. This digital binding is not delivered yet.
- Anonymized approved bills: stable source reference, original amount/currency, due date,
  budget category, vendor alias, business approval and recurring-obligation evidence if relevant.
- Current approved finance policy, authorized reviewers, exact mirror-rate/rounding rule,
  allowlisted controlled testnet recipients, spend/fee caps and stop/recovery owner.

Planning proposes payment order and use of the existing approved allocation. It explains
budget conflicts, reserve holds, due dates and missing evidence; it cannot reallocate funds
between departments, change restricted-fund uses or approve new business obligations.
A finance administrator must authorize those business decisions separately.

**No student dependency:** staff-verified aggregate inputs still suffice. Keep the merged
portal optional and harden its existing tuition use case rather than building another payment
portal or expanding to grades/attendance/new SIS/bank integrations. Source-linked digital
intake must not block an institution with zero student rows from planning approved bills.

### 14.3 Parallel Operation and Exact Testnet Mirroring

1. Keep the college's actual collections, statutory accounts and payments in local currency
   through its existing process. Pilot access is read-only or approved anonymized extracts;
   OpenSinop has no authority to debit the college's bank account or mainnet treasury.
2. Preserve each source amount/currency and reference. Use an immutable, staff-approved
   reference-rate snapshot, source/time and explicit rounding rule to derive exact
   six-decimal USDC mirror units. Do not assume one local-currency unit equals one USDC.
   This mapping is a **testnet representation**, not executable FX or fiat settlement.
3. Link the source bill and original proposal to the staff decision or approved standing
   policy, exact payment intent, provider attempt and verified Arc testnet transaction.
   Each eligible approved item must reach verified mirror settlement once; failures remain
   visible unresolved cases, never silently reported as paid. An unrelated token transfer
   or fake-driver receipt cannot satisfy this requirement.
4. Send only through the existing Circle Agent Wallet/Lepton path on `ARC-TESTNET` with
   checked chain ID `5042002`. Use actual faucet-funded balances and protect fee allowance;
   no implicit mainnet fallback or authority derived from seeded ledger funds.
5. Map each vendor alias to an explicitly approved, operator-controlled testnet recipient.
   Verify ownership/control and record the mapping offchain. Do not invent addresses or
   imply the real vendor accepts USDC or received the college's real payment. Section 15.2
   classifies this recipient as a `pilot_testnet_alias` — an institution-operated address
   standing in for a counterparty, permanently labelled simulation, not a vendor wallet.
6. Keep **local actual-payment state separate from testnet mirror state**. A verified mirror
   may consume its pilot reservation, but must not settle the real local payable, create
   college income or replace its accounting/bank evidence. The same separation applies to
    imported collections and budgets; a mirrored allocation is not new cash.
7. Apply the same boundary to **student Pay Now**: faucet-funded Arc testnet USDC may fund
   approved pilot USDC capacity after verification, but cannot clear real local tuition or
   become actual college income. A balance observation already containing these funds must
   not have the receipts added to it again. The portal must identify network/simulation mode
   before confirmation, and use only explicitly designated pilot tuition accounts until a
   separately reviewed real-payment release exists.

**Funding feasibility:** preflight the actual USDC total plus fees before selecting bills.
Faucet amounts/rate limits may block full-value mirroring; do not loop faucet requests,
seed imaginary funds or silently scale the college's numbers. Select smaller real bills or
obtain sufficient verified testnet funding with operator approval. If a scaled synthetic
demo is needed, label it separately and disclose it to the college/organizer; it is not
full-value settlement evidence for the real-bill pilot.

### 14.4 Human Approval and Capped Autonomous Lanes

**Default lane: agent proposes, authorized finance staff approves.** Show original/local
and mirror amounts, due date, source evidence, policy version, passed/failed checks,
remaining allocation, commitments, reserve/fee impact and destination before review.
Approve/reject requires authenticated role/ownership checks and auditable staff identity;
a supplied CLI staff ID alone is not proof of personal approval.

Staff edits count as feedback, not permission to mutate an approved intent. Preserve the
original proposal and reasons for changes; use the delivered independently reviewed draft
replacement workflow, then separately authorize payment when that gate exists. C1 drafts
cannot be edited or executed. Reviewed cancellation is terminal for this document; replacement
creates a fresh draft only. A second key alone cannot bypass either boundary.
Rejection and a policy hold cause no transfer. Human approval cannot bypass a hard rule.

**Opt-in autonomous lane: testnet only, zero allowance until staff approves standing policy.**
After the human path passes its gates, allow recurring payments without per-item review
only when all deterministic checks pass:
- Existing business-approved recurring obligation within the agreed department/period;
  no new purchase, inferred recurrence or LLM-created debt.
- Approved vendor alias and versioned, verified controlled testnet destination; destination
  changes require independent review, not an emailed address or model suggestion.
- Exact amount at or below the reviewed per-payment cap, within cumulative daily/pilot
  limits, available departmental allocation, verified wallet funds, reserve and fee ceiling.
  Count settled spending and outstanding reservations; concurrent proposals cannot reuse funds.
- Current policy, source document, mirror snapshot and authority match the approved intent;
  revalidate before submission. Stale or changed evidence requires fresh review.
- Durable retry identity, reservation and attempt state; enabled stop switch and known
  outcome. Missing, conflicting, suspicious or unknown evidence stays held/unresolved.

An otherwise valid bill outside the autonomous lane goes to human review. Budget/reserve,
destination, network or integrity failures stay blocked until corrected and re-evaluated;
not every failed automatic check is an approvable exception. Model output may propose or
explain, never authorize, loosen limits, access keys/OTPs or acquire unrestricted shell access.
Application enforcement is mandatory; do not advertise Circle's mainnet-only native
wallet policies as testnet enforcement.

### 14.5 Ordered Implementation Work and Exit Gates

No new feature is complete merely because its checklist appears here. Reuse institution
context, `Invoice`, budget, finance policy, draft intent and Lepton seams; extend only what
this slice requires. No wallet-model migration, parallel ERP or required extra AI agent.

**Implementation clarification from the owner:** shadow/parallel is a demo operating
practice, not an application domain. No dedicated shadow models, tables, routes, screens
or testnet-only finance feature. Build reusable institutional invoice/budget/review/payment
workflows; the demo exercises those same workflows with explicitly authorized testnet
configuration and controlled recipients. Keep real local accounting separate from network
payment evidence; a testnet transaction must not settle a real payable.

**Delivered normal finance evidence/planning foundation (partial Step 2):** `InvoiceVersion`
and `InvoiceVersionReview` bind exact source money in supported currencies (including USDC),
source/business-approval references, department/period, an explicit USDC reference rate,
source/time and rounding to an existing institution `Invoice`. A separate authenticated
admin approves evidence, rejects or holds it against the expected digest. Evidence review
is not business entitlement verification, payment approval or executable FX. No chain or
demo payment state is hardcoded into these records. Source money is staff-supplied exact
input, never inferred from legacy floats. A change fingerprint detects legacy document
edits without pretending to recover original precision. Conflicting retries, self-review,
foreign/stale/tampered evidence fail closed. Invoice-source-version successors still require
implementation; payment-draft successors are delivered separately below.

`BudgetSnapshot` captures exact staff-attested approved allocation, already-spent and other
budget commitments separately from opening funds, realized receipts, actual outflows,
restricted cash, protected reserve and other cash commitments. Allocation is not cash;
forecast revenue cannot fund a plan. All inputs use exact decimal strings/integer units;
headroom uses arbitrary precision and preserves deficits. Each capture binds a closed set
of invoice-version/review digests, department/period, source references, as-of/expiry and
budget change fingerprint. Staff attests that selected bills are excluded from other
commitments and protection buckets are disjoint.

`DepartmentBudgetPlanner` applies cumulative allocation/cash checks by due date and ID.
Drift, expiry or corrupt bound evidence blocks the entire plan rather than freeing uncertain
cash for another bill. Authenticated JSON input/show/review/planning routes are
`finance.invoice-versions.*` and `finance.budget-snapshots.*`; staff UI/import files remain
open. Evidence is immutable with restrictive FKs and populated-rollback refusal. Versioned
invoices remain blocked from legacy float policy/payment execution. Independently reviewed
exact USDC invoice versions now bind non-executable drafts; local reference valuations do
not become USDC payment authority. Reviewed vendor destination versions/approvals bind
draft recipients and chain identity. No invoice payment state, wallet or budget is changed by capture,
review or planning. Outputs remain `can_execute=false`, no reservation, no verified funding,
no payment approval or transfer. Staff attestation is not independent bank/rate verification.

**Delivered collections-to-budget foundation (partial Step 2):** `CollectionBatch` captures
exact aggregate received fee money and restrictions in supported currencies, source stream,
canonical reference, SHA-256 source-document digest, half-open collection interval and source
cash evidence. Separate verified admin `CollectionBatchReview` records `approve_receipts`,
`reject` or `hold`, expected digest, independent verification reference and reason. Self-review,
conflicting retries, duplicate source documents/references and overlapping intervals within
one declared stream are refused. Held/rejected/unreviewed batches cannot fund a plan. Source
streams must be genuinely disjoint; staff attestation and document hashes cannot detect the
same underlying receipts repackaged into a different report/stream. No individual matching,
bank API reconciliation, official receipt issuance or student adverse decision is introduced.

New schema-v2 `BudgetSnapshot` binds reviewed collection IDs/digests through restrictive FKs.
Gross realized receipts must equal the exact sum; restricted cash must include every bound
restriction. Opening funds explicitly exclude selected receipts. Planner rechecks complete
bindings and blocks the whole plan on missing/tampered evidence. Schema-v1 snapshots remain
readable as `legacy_staff_attestation`; they are not backfilled with inferred reviews and
cannot create new funding windows. Reusing receipts across alternative read-only snapshots
is not duplicate income or a funded allocation; institution-wide posting/department allocation
remains future. Funding rollover **is now delivered** (`RollOverFundingWindow`), and it renews
the clock rather than re-granting cash — the hold chain is cumulative and institution-wide, and a
rollover can only replace a window that has already expired. JSON endpoints are
`finance.collection-batches.*`.
No gateway call, currency conversion, new cash, wallet mutation or transfer occurs. PHP/local
fee evidence does not become USDC; approved testnet mirroring still needs separate mapping
and funding authority. Staff review UI/import and collection correction/revocation remain open.

**Delivered draft recovery foundation (partial Step 3):** `PaymentIntentChange` and separate
`PaymentIntentChangeReview` preserve staff correction/rejection reasons, independently
accept terminal cancellation or create an exact fresh successor, and prevent new-key bypass.
Payment draft replacement rechecks current bill, treasury, policy and destination at review;
material drift requires a fresh proposal. Review, successor and audit commit together.
Outputs remain `payment_approved=false`, `funds_reserved=false`, `can_execute=false`.
No gateway call, invoice-payment-state change or balance mutation occurs. Source-version
replacement, staff UI and post-reservation/submission recovery are not delivered by this slice.

**Delivered bounded funding/reservation foundation (partial Step 3):** one independently
reviewed `FundingWindow` binds exact USDC departmental evidence and block-bound native Arc
balance, then `PaymentReservation` holds cumulative bill and fee capacity atomically.
No local reference-rate valuation becomes executable FX or a testnet mirror funding lane.
One approved window per institution prevents cross-window/cross-wallet capacity reuse until
reviewed rollover exists. New holds require fresh matching treasury/policy/evidence; expiry
and conflicts keep previous holds counted. Independent SQLite-worker contention is tested;
PostgreSQL production concurrency is not certified. Reserved drafts require future reviewed
release before cancellation/replacement. Fake evidence stays labeled; hold output is
`funds_reserved=true`, `external_funds_locked=false`, `payment_approved=false`, `can_execute=false`.

**Delivered payment review foundation (partial B4):** `PaymentAuthorization` records an
independent `approve_payment`, `reject_payment` or `hold_payment` for an exact reserved bill.
`PaymentReviewerEnrollment` pins an existing authenticator after another verified admin's
password/TOTP-backed identity/control attestation. Payment reviewer needs verified email,
finance/admin role and directly assigned `AuthorizePayment:PaymentIntent`; role inheritance
or seeding cannot grant it. Draft/reservation maker cannot review own payment. Factor
replacement/disablement or permission removal invalidates current payment eligibility.
Review requires fresh password/TOTP, exact bound digests, current policy/document/destination/
funding and all cumulative held costs against fresh Arc cash. Approval expires within five
minutes and funding expiry. Replay steps persist atomically with review; login markers are
checked; authentication attempt counters survive failed transactions. Safe evidence excludes
passwords, OTPs and factor fingerprints. `PaymentReviews` uses ordinary finance panel and
same action as authenticated JSON endpoints, not a dedicated demo workflow.

Same-key retry returns historical evidence without renewal; changed decisions/new keys are
refused. Reject/hold never frees reservations. Fake evidence remains simulation-only;
mainnet is blocked and every output retains `can_execute=false`. This first slice permits
one review per reserved bill: cross-endpoint MFA race certification remains a gate before any
execution. No transfer, local accounting mutation or settlement proof is introduced.

Step 1 still requires college confirmation and separate permissions. Destination suspension/
cooling-off and control certification, source-version successors, reviewed reservation release/
funding rollover, local-to-testnet mapping authority, approval renewal/withdrawal and factor
recovery, durable attempts/recovery, execution-time fees/funding, verified Arc settlement and
production concurrency remain gates. Model immutability/digests do not protect against privileged DB
rewrites with recomputed hashes. No completed staff pilot or actual payment is claimed.

**Background/supervision delivery overlay:** Sections 14.7–14.10 extend this sequence with
cashier handoff, durable event-driven work, a finance supervisor dashboard and notifications.
Build non-executable background planning/approval routing before enabling payments; then
prove the human payment lane before the separately reviewed recurring lane. Cashier receipt
entry, business approval, payment authorization and notification acknowledgement are different
acts. A browser button or chat prompt is an optional trigger, never the runtime requirement.

1. **Confirm pilot with college.** Name finance/department/operator owners; agree problem,
   baseline, records, budget, dates, permissions, reference-rate mapping and limits. Record
   separate consent for external AI processing, testnet transfers and public evidence.
2. **Bind collected-fee evidence and proposals.** Capture/review exact aggregate receipts and
   restrictions; bind them to local approved bills, allocation, opening-fund exclusions and
   commitments. Next add staff input/review UI/import and explicit approved local-to-testnet
   mapping with separate actual/mirror states. Resolve
   required legacy float/storage gaps on this path; preview cannot supply guessed exact funds.
3. **Complete C1 authorization.** Reviewed destinations, authenticated staff review, immutable
   decision/proposal history, safe successor workflow, atomic cumulative reservations and
   durable intent/outbox/attempt identity. Test same-item retries and simultaneous approvals.
4. **Complete C2 execution and evidence.** Explicit testnet-only opt-in, checked wallet/chain,
   fee preflight, isolated executor, stop switch and recovery. Verify successful receipt,
   matching chain/asset/sender/recipient/amount and finality before marking mirror settled.
   Null RPC, timeout or uncertain provider response stays pending/unknown; reconcile the
   existing attempt rather than submitting a blind retry or declaring fabrication.
5. **Prove human lane end to end.** Staff uses a real approved bill; its approved proposal
   produces one verified testnet transfer with audit/export evidence. Repeat review, job and
   reconciliation without duplicate payment; show rejected/held bills cause no transfer.
6. **Enable capped lane separately.** Staff approves narrow recurring-payment policy and
   limits. Demonstrate an eligible automatic testnet payment, a human escalation and a hard
   policy hold; verify cap boundaries, cumulative overspend/concurrency and stop behavior.
7. **Capture pilot evidence and decide expansion.** Compare decisions/time with baseline;
   obtain authorized staff-usage video and collaboration proof; review value with the college.
   Expand departments first, then deeper collections/C3, then optional student assistance
   only when users need it and privacy/business approvals permit it.

Required automated tests use synthetic records and fake gateways by default. Cover exact
source/mirror precision and rounding, source/approval drift, roles/ownership, zero-student
operation, local/testnet state separation, approve/reject/hold and autonomous boundaries,
duplicate/concurrent/crash/unknown/restore cases, reverted or mismatched receipts, fake
labelling and stop behavior. Real testnet proof is a separately consented run, not routine CI.
Existing student-aid tests/features stay intact; their existence is not pilot acceptance.

### 14.6 Traction Evidence and Honest Metrics

Priority evidence, collected with the college's permission:
- **Staff-usage video and collaboration proof:** actual finance staff operating the tool,
  not only a developer demo. Obtain permission for recording and public name/logo/quotes;
  willingness to explore does not authorize an endorsement claim.
- **Connected payments:** anonymized bill/proposal reference, reasoning and policy checks,
  reviewer decision or standing-policy authority, exact local/mirror mapping, verified
  transaction/explorer link and audit record for every executed item. Show unresolved
  attempts honestly; fake or scaled synthetic examples are separate.
- **Human review quality:** record original proposals approved as-is, edited, rejected,
  held and pending. Define approval-as-is rate as approved-as-is / resolved human-reviewed
  original proposals (approved-as-is + edited + rejected); report holds/pending separately
  and prevent repeated reviews or revisions from inflating counts. An edit is not approval
  of the original proposal and needs its own successor authorization.
- **Review effort:** measure comparable staff review time against the agreed baseline,
  include data-entry/correction overhead and sample sizes, and distinguish active review
  time from waiting/settlement delay. Do not invent savings or percentages.
- **Autonomy and escalation:** count auto-authorized, human-review, held/rejected, submitted,
  verified and pending/failed outcomes separately. Post-run staff agreement with automatic
  decisions is retrospective feedback, not per-item approval or proof of correctness.
- **Staff feedback:** collect permissioned quotes and concrete examples of useful reasoning,
  wrong recommendations or remaining work. Report limitations alongside successes.

Keep identifying student/vendor data, invoice text, bank details and private documents
offchain. Even public wallet addresses and amounts can be linkable; explain this before
consent and do not assume anonymization removes all privacy risk. Public proof may use
opaque references and permitted redacted excerpts. No student grades, attendance, hardship
or subjective "morals" assessment is needed for this pilot.

**Pilot done means:** confirmed useful departmental problem, staff-operated workflow,
linked successful testnet payments for eligible approved items, separately authorized capped
lane demonstrated, rejected/held paths safe, replay/recovery checked and permissioned
user/payment/metric evidence collected. It does **not** mean real college bills were paid
by OpenSinop, student fees were collected onchain, production/mainnet readiness, measured
adoption beyond the observed pilot, or a guaranteed Arc/Circle shoutout.

**Deferred scope:** all-institution autonomous treasury; production student payment intake and
bank/FX adapters; payroll execution/tax calculations; assistance eligibility, discounts,
installments and student employment; grades/attendance/hardship assessment; Developer-Controlled
Wallet migration; Gateway/x402/escrow/Earn/Borrow. Preserve existing modules and revisit them
only after college validation, not because the broad architecture makes them possible.
The narrow student tuition UI already merged is retained as a testnet integration target
under §14.10; merge alone does not remove production/custody or institutional-consent gates.

### 14.7 Cashier Intake, Policy Decisions and Bounded Autonomy

**Status (2026-10-13):** cashier capture/review screens are delivered. Portal movement checks and
attempt/receipt records exist, and the B0 slice now supplies immutable quote/consent, an expiring
accepted fee ceiling, chain/purpose/stop guards, a named recovery owner, provider-handle async
observation and no-resend recovery. A live run remains unproven: submission is off by default and
the installed rail cannot enforce a fee ceiling, so it refuses before signing. B1 supports manual
reconciliation into a source-linked Collections receipt. B2 now binds
approved, matching-attempt digital receipts into a staff-captured schema v3 plan, excludes typed
opening funds when counting those receipts, and wakes its planning run after commit. Automatic
import/receipt-to-budget selection remain unbuilt. Neither intake screen establishes outgoing
execution or real tuition clearance. Tuition is the first example; intake can
later cover laboratory/registration/examination fees, service charges, donations, grants,
rentals and other approved receipts. Different receipt types must not be collapsed into
unrestricted tuition revenue. Refundable deposits, overpayments, restricted gifts and
unidentified receipts require separate liability/restriction/suspense treatment.

**Cashier is a workflow hub, not the destination of every payment rail.** Physical cash,
bank deposits and supported electronic payments stay in institution-approved accounts and
processes, not a cashier's personal wallet. Cashier records the official reference, source,
exact amount/currency, category, time and reconciliation evidence. Finance/accounting sees
incoming and outgoing evidence in one supervised workspace; collection entries, approved
payables, refunds, transfers and accounting adjustments remain distinct document types.
Do not force supplier payments, payroll or every source system through a new cashier app.

| Owner | Permitted responsibility | Prohibited shortcut |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Student/payer | Pay through approved channels; optional portal confirmation binds the exact payer/account/amount/network/fee limit | Paying, uploading proof or owning a login cannot declare funds reconciled, prove key custody or approve institutional spending |
| Cashier/intake staff | Record/import received money, classify against approved categories, flag unmatched or reversed items and prepare reconciled collection batches | Cannot independently verify their own batch, alter budget policy or grant payment authority merely by entering money |
| Accounting/reconciliation reviewer | Independently verify collections, restrictions, opening-fund exclusions, receipt matching and source consistency | Does not infer bank balance from an upload or treat a testnet transfer as real tuition revenue |
| Finance officer/supervisor | Review proposals, funding and exceptions; authorize permitted payments or submit policy/mandate changes for independent review | Dashboard access is not universal payment approval; no approval overrides a hard rule |
| Authorized policy/mandate reviewers | Approve allocation, reserves, limits, vendor/destination versions and recurring scope with maker/checker separation | No agent or policy maker may self-authorize a mandate |
| Background workflow service | Observe approved evidence, calculate exact headroom, prepare bounded proposals and route tasks under explicit institution-scoped service permissions | Must not impersonate a human admin, invent approver IDs, verify cashier evidence or change its own privileges |
| Isolated executor/reconciler | Submit authorized exact intents through Circle/Lepton and independently verify Arc outcomes | No unrestricted shell, arbitrary beneficiaries, silent mainnet fallback or hash-only settlement |

Cashier/accountant are business responsibilities above, **not newly shipped role enum values**.
Initial staff can receive explicit capabilities under existing roles; add dedicated roles
only with policies, scoped queries and separation tests. A read-only accountant/auditor may
supervise without release permission. Individual portal matching now has student/account
records, but strong receipt attribution and planning integration remain targets. Preserve the
zero-student aggregate lane and a separately scoped read-only accountant/auditor capability.

Target lifecycle for receipts:
1. Record a received or reported receipt against its authoritative source. Expected fees,
   pending bank transfers and uploaded claims remain unverified; do not count them as cash.
   Direct portal attempts enter a durable receipt-status queue, not a second manual upload.
   Provider acceptance and a transaction hash are intermediate states, never receipt approval.
2. Cashier reconciles sources and prepares aggregate batches. Independent reviewer approves,
   holds or rejects source evidence; unresolved items remain outside available funds.
3. Committed review triggers background re-evaluation of affected approved departmental plans.
   Preserve exact original currency, collection references, restrictions and as-of/expiry.
4. Compute cash and allocation separately; deduct commitments, protected amounts and active
   reservations without overlap. Student payment does not authorize a new spending split.
5. Classify each existing approved obligation as hard-blocked, eligible for human review,
   or eligible under a previously authorized recurring mandate. Store rule results/reasons.
6. Submit only after payment/mapping/funding/identity gates exist and pass. Pilot receipts
   from bank/cash stay local. Verified portal testnet inflows may contribute to the observed
   pilot treasury, separately from real receipts; its current balance is counted once and a
   fresh reviewed funding window is still required before approved mirror outflows.
7. Reconcile outcomes and notify owners. Receipt corrections/reversals create new evidence,
   re-evaluate dependent proposals and freeze unsafe new releases; do not rewrite history or
   undo a settled transfer. Current collection correction/revocation remains implementation work.

**Two authorization levels, not two kinds of safety:** humans first authorize institution
policy and recurring mandate. Eligible occurrences can then run without another approval;
other otherwise-valid bills require per-item authorization. Cashier receipt review, business
approval, policy/mandate approval, funding review and payment approval remain separate.

Proposed recurring mandate must bind institution, department/budget, business-approved
contract/obligation, vendor and independently reviewed destination, exact `ARC-TESTNET` /
`5042002` identity, currency/mirror mapping, start/end dates, due window, allowed frequency,
per-occurrence amount ceiling, fee ceiling, cumulative daily and mandate-period limits,
policy version, independent reviewers and revocation state. Initial allowance is zero.
Missing evidence means no automatic payment; an LLM cannot infer that a bill is recurring.

An occurrence is automatically authorized only when **every** check passes:
- It corresponds to an actual approved bill/contract period, within mandate dates and due
  window, with a unique obligation-plus-occurrence identity and no prior fulfilment.
- Exact bill/mirror amount is at or below the approved ceiling; changed price/scope or
  destination is held for renewed review, not guessed from last month's payment.
- Current source/collection/policy/destination evidence and separately approved mapping
  remain valid. The bill fits approved budget and actual available USDC after reserves,
  restrictions, commitments, all active holds and fee protection.
- Per-payment and cumulative caps count submitted/unknown attempts, settled spending and
  outstanding reservations without double-counting. No bill splitting or mandate reset
  bypass; retries of one occurrence retain provider identity, even across multiple triggers.
- Rail/session/funding readiness and stop switch permit new submission. Reserve and record
  durable authorization/outbox before external I/O; revalidate in the isolated executor.

At the exact cap boundary `amount <= ceiling` is permitted if all other checks pass.
Eligible bills outside mandate scope go to human review; invalid destination, restricted-use,
insufficient budget/cash, integrity or network failures are **blocked**, not approvable overrides.
Missed cycles do not auto-pay an unbounded backlog; catch-up requires reviewed scope and caps.
A recurring schedule creates a work item, not a new debt, price agreement or consent.

### 14.8 Background Operation and Safe System-Generated Prompts

**Requirement:** work continues while no one is chatting or viewing the dashboard. Use one
institution orchestration service with persisted specialist tasks; several AI processes or
one autonomous LLM per department are not required. Separate task ownership from reasoning
technology: deterministic workers can perform most finance tasks without an AI provider.

| Logical worker/task | Wake condition | Result / authority |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Collections observer | Cashier capture/review, approved import, strongly verified portal receipt, reversal or reconciliation event | Source-linked receipt intake and duplicate checks; no self-approval of restrictions or spending |
| Budget planner | Reviewed collection, approved bill/budget/policy change, scheduled due-date scan | Exact pay/hold/review proposals and cash-impact evidence; no allocation change |
| Approval coordinator | New review-required proposal, reviewer decision, deadline/reminder | Durable approval work item and role-scoped notification; silence never means consent |
| Recurring payment operator | Approved mandate occurrence becomes due or an eligible hold is explicitly re-evaluated | Deterministic automatic authorization within mandate after all release gates; no model-only authority |
| Circle execution worker | Durable authorized outbox item, not an arbitrary prompt | Idempotent submission through Lepton, bounded fee/chain checks and stored attempt |
| Settlement reconciler | Submitted/pending/unknown attempt, provider event or scheduled sweep | Matching receipt/finality evidence or unresolved case; no blind new transfer |
| Optional AI analyst | New material facts/proposal or authorized staff question | Evidence-grounded explanation and allowed next-task suggestion; no direct signing or policy edits |

These names describe proposed capabilities, not seven shipped agents or required new models.
Reuse existing planner, reviewed records and gateway seams; add only durable event/run/work-item
records needed for restart-safe coordination. Human chat may ask for explanation or request a
recheck, but must call the same authorization and deduplication path as background events.

**Event and runtime contract:**
- Persist source event and workflow/outbox entry atomically with the domain change. Dispatch
  only after commit; a periodic sweeper recovers committed-but-undispatched work. Laravel
  `afterCommit` prevents early reads but alone does not close the commit-to-broker crash gap.
- Bound each event by institution, source event ID/type, affected document/version/digest,
  actor or service principal, occurred/received times and correlation ID. Reload current
  evidence/permissions in the job; stale events never replay an outdated approval.
- Use a supervised durable database/Redis queue, not `sync`, request-only `defer`, or the
  non-durable `background` driver for financial work. Initial target: scheduler tick every
  minute enqueues bounded scans; choose institution-approved due windows and reconciliation
  intervals instead of treating every tick as authority. HTTP, scheduler and worker processes
  share the release but run independently; production supervisors restart failed processes.
- Apply scheduler overlap/single-server controls and shared per-institution/resource job
  locks where relevant. DB uniqueness, atomic reservations and durable transitions remain
  authoritative: queue uniqueness/cache locks alone cannot guarantee one payment.
- Persist run state (`queued`, `running`, `waiting_for_approval`, `blocked`, `completed`,
  `failed`, `paused`), current stage, last heartbeat, attempts, last error and bounded next
  wake time. Keep external payment states separate; a completed planning run is not paid.
- Bound documents per pass, execution time, retry count/backoff and AI tokens/tool steps/cost.
  Set queue visibility/retry delay longer than job timeout. Exhausted or uncertain work opens
  an explicit investigation case, rather than creating a new payment identity.
- Approval wait is a persisted pause, not a sleeping worker or repeated model polling.
  Only a scoped reviewer decision, relevant evidence change or bounded reminder wakes it.
- Multi-step work can enqueue an allowlisted dependent task after durable completion. A model
  may suggest an allowed follow-up, but PHP chooses whether/when it runs, validates its
  context, caps task depth and deduplicates the dependency. No arbitrary cron, shell command,
  web target or self-spawn loop may be accepted from model output.

**Meaning of “prompt themselves”:** authenticated events and the scheduler create bounded
work automatically; PHP builds a task-specific prompt from institution-owned evidence when
optional AI is enabled. A recurring bill can be detected, checked, authorized and paid under
standing policy without any chat prompt or synchronous LLM call. Agent initiative is deciding
which eligible work to process or escalate inside approved authority—not inventing goals,
obligations, recipients or spending policies. Documents/messages remain untrusted prompt data.
AI disclosure/provider controls still apply; no secrets, OTPs or unrestricted financial data
are passed to the model. Unavailable AI degrades explanations, not deterministic finance checks.

**Delivered background foundation:** `FinanceWorkflowRun` persists cashier-review/budget-plan
work, bounded attempts/heartbeat/backoff, review wait and notification delivery state.
`ProcessFinanceWorkflow` uses durable `finance-planning` queue; per-minute
`opensinop:dispatch-finance-workflows` recovers committed work with scheduler overlap controls.
Finance Supervisor/Collections pages inspect evidence and record independent plan/receipt
decisions. Runtime defaults off and refuses `sync`. None of these tasks submits payments.

**Current blockers:** existing `OpenSinopAgent::runAutonomousCycle` and dashboard button use
legacy execution and must not be scheduled as this workflow. New model/sessionless work needs explicit institution-scoped
service authority, not a fabricated human actor passed to current staff actions. **Reviewed
release and rollover are now delivered**, so the funding-hold blocker is gone; what is left is a
live testnet run of the executor path and then the standing mandate itself. Never silently
refresh expiry, re-review collection evidence or reset cumulative caps on each scheduler tick —
`RollOverFundingWindow` refuses precisely those things. Background read-only planning can ship
before these payment gates; signing remains disabled meanwhile.

**Resolved into a delivery order:** §17.3 traces the end-to-end flow step by step and shows
that steps 2–12 of the authorization chain are built and tested, leaving a live testnet run as
the only step before the §14.4 Step 4 target. §18.7 ordered the remaining work: reviewed release
and rollover → durable outbox and attempt identity → isolated executor and Arc verification →
standing mandate. **The first three are delivered; the mandate has deliberately not been started
yet.** Do not build the mandate before the executor chain has run live (§18.8).

### 14.9 Finance Supervisor Dashboard and Approval Notifications

**Target:** normal finance workspace for cashier, accounting and finance operations. Start
with the existing Filament finance panel rather than a parallel demo app; reuse existing
notification storage. Finance Supervisor, Collections and Payment Reviews now expose normal
planning/intake/review workflows. Run polling is not worker execution, and configured panel
login MFA alone does not prove privileged-action MFA or vendor-payment approval.
Existing legacy Approval Center must not be presented as the new safe authorization path.

Dashboard must show:
- Collections by source/type/currency: reported, reconciled, independently reviewed,
  restricted, suspense/unmatched and reversed; no fabricated available balance.
- Exact approved allocation versus local cash, commitments and held capacity, plus separate
  observed Arc testnet balance/fees, network, source time, freshness and fake labels.
- Work by logical worker/run: task purpose, triggering event, affected document, stage,
  last/next run, queued/running/waiting/blocked/failed state, last heartbeat and actionable error.
- Approval inbox with assigned owner, age/deadline, exact original/mirror amounts, due date,
  policy/mandate version, source evidence, checks, reservation impact and destination version.
- Automatic lane with mandate owner/expiry, per-item/daily/period remaining allowances,
  upcoming occurrences and auto-authorized/submitted/verified/held counts. Automatic work
  remains visible even when no approval notification is needed.
- Evidence-linked timeline: source event, deterministic decision, optional AI summary,
  human/standing authorization, reservation, provider attempt, verification and follow-up.
  Show recorded rule results and public summaries, not hidden model chain-of-thought.
- Operations health: scheduler/worker heartbeat, queue lag, stale funding, notifications
  awaiting delivery, provider-session readiness and unresolved payment outcomes.

Supervisor actions: inspect evidence, assign/reassign work, approve/reject within capability,
request correction through reviewed successor workflows, retry known-safe read/reconciliation
work, suspend a mandate and pause new submissions. Changing policy needs its own independent
review. Approval binds an exact immutable version and fresh step-up/MFA evidence; changed
payloads require new authorization. Batch approval must validate each item, never bypass caps.
A service principal cannot approve its own run; maker/checker follows evidence makers, not
merely whoever clicked the last UI button.

**Notifications:**
- Persist an approval/investigation work item before sending. Target currently authorized
  institution reviewers who can act independently; no eligible reviewer is itself an alert.
- In-app database inbox first, with bounded polling in the finance panel; queued email is
  optional. Reuse Laravel/Filament notifications, not a new messaging dependency. WebSockets
  may follow later; polling updates visibility and never drives background finance execution.
- Queue delivery after commit through durable notification/outbox work, deduplicate by work
  item/version, recipient and alert stage, retry delivery independently of payment processing.
- Notify for approval required, approaching cutoff, hard hold/shortfall, worker/provider
  failure, unknown/mismatched payment or integrity incident. Group routine automatic successes
  into a digest; preserve their detailed timeline without flooding supervisors.
- Reminder intervals, quiet hours, escalation owner and maximum reminders are configurable.
  Failure to open/read/respond must never approve, submit, refresh funding or release holds.
- Email/push contains minimal opaque references; authenticated dashboard resolves sensitive
  content. Reading/dismissing notification is not approving work. Links recheck role, institution,
  current version and MFA; no money-moving approval by GET link or trusted email reply.
- Stop switch blocks newly queued and already queued-but-not-submitted releases at executor
  time. Preserve in-flight reconciliation, evidence and read access; do not erase unknowns or
  assume stopping a worker reverses a submitted transfer.

### 14.10 Post-Merge Intake Integration, Delivery Order and Acceptance Tests

**Revised 2026-10-12 after PR #14:** preserve the merged student dashboard/wallet experience
and the delivered cashier screens. Close the direct-payment correctness gaps before letting
portal receipts increase available cash or trigger outgoing execution. This is one finance
workflow with two entry channels, not a second student treasury or a new autonomous agent.
No implementation, wallet generation, funding or transfer is authorized by this plan update.

#### 14.10.1 What the merge supplies, and what is still missing

| Area | Merged capability | Integration/release gate still required |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Student entry | `/student/dashboard` has Pay Now; `/student/wallet` shows the linked address and observed balance | Clear testnet/fake labels, exact amount entry, payer consent and history/status for each tuition attempt |
| Quote and send | Authenticated `student.tuition.quote` / `student.tuition.pay`; student-owned account lookup; server-selected treasury | Institution/chain/asset/wallet-status guards, purpose-specific payment enable/stop controls, accepted fee ceiling and expiring quote, durable pre-send identity |
| Tuition receipt | `StudentTuitionPayment` stores student/account/wallet, amount, fee, addresses, chain, hash and a verification flag | Actual receipt/movement proof; async provider-handle resolution; unique verified receipt/allocation; immutable, recoverable posting |
| Current posting | `pay()` increments `TuitionAccount.paid_amount` and may credit the matching `Wallet` / create `CONFIRMED` `Transaction` | It currently posts even if verification is false, and fake verification returns true. This must not become trusted collection cash or real tuition clearance |
| Retry and recovery | A random provider UUID is generated per pay call | Persist one request/intent before external I/O; reuse its identity across refresh/retry; observe uncertain attempts instead of sending again |
| Fees and amounts | Exact principal stored at six decimals; fee retained as a string | Failed/malformed fee reads currently become zero; affordability truncates fee, and ledger writes use floats. Separate estimated/actual fee evidence and preserve exact totals |
| Staff wallet view | Admin student detail has balance/provenance and Generate wallet; funding has explicit operator commands | Generation currently reuses student-view permission. Mutations need dedicated manage authority, consent, signer/owner evidence and serialized slot allocation; view permission is not signing authority |
| Collections/planning | Cashier capture/review and closed-set budget workflows already exist | B1 supplies manual reconciliation of an eligible payment into a source-linked receipt. B2 now binds independently approved receipts into a staff-captured schema v3 plan with movement/opening-funds exclusion and an after-commit queue wake. Automatic import and receipt-triggered successor-plan preparation remain open |

**Gate before more live portal testing:** independently audit existing `StudentTuitionPayment`,
related transactions and balances. Treat current `tx_verified_on_chain` / `CONFIRMED` labels as
claims to recheck, not evidence to promote. Preserve any discrepancy and history. Do not resend,
delete records, reverse tuition balances or rewrite confirmations automatically. The product
owner must explicitly authorize any pause/configuration change or financial correction.

**B0 safety changes shipped 2026-10-12; acceptance incomplete.** Movement verification before
posting, fake-driver exclusion and a unique receipt request key exist. The follow-up slice of
2026-10-13 adds immutable pre-send consent, an expiring quote/accepted fee ceiling, chain/purpose/
stop guards and provider-handle no-resend recovery (§14.10.4). What is still not closed is a live
end-to-end run on a rail that can enforce that ceiling. Existing flags and balances remain
claims requiring the audit above; no automatic financial correction is authorized.

| Merged defect | Closure |
| --- | --- |
| Posted even when verification returned false; fake verification returned true | `pay()` posts only on `verdict === 'verified'` from `ArcSettlementVerifier` — the same predicate the outgoing lane uses, not a weaker copy. `mismatched`, `reverted`, `not_found` and `unreadable` write no receipt, no `paid_amount` increment and no ledger row, and raise an error telling the payer not to send again |
| Verified only transaction presence | Receipt `status === '0x1'`, committed `blockNumber`, and the USDC Transfer log's payer/recipient/exact amount at emitter-specific decimals |
| Fresh provider UUID per pay call | `StudentTuitionPaymentAttempt` is written before the signer is reached, keyed on a server-minted `request_key` (`updateOrCreate`). The same key is the provider idempotency key and a unique index on `student_tuition_payments`, so a repeated confirmation returns the receipt already posted |
| Failed/malformed fee quotes became zero | `quoteFee()` throws on an unreadable, malformed or zero `networkFee` rather than falling back to `'0.000000'` |
| Fee affordability truncated | `feeBaseUnits($fee, roundUp: true)` for affordability, so a wallet holding exactly the quoted total is not short by a sub-unit remainder |
| Exact ledger crosses and float formatting | Balances and owed amounts format through `Amounts::toDecimalString`, not `%.2f` |
| Fake-driver payments settled tuition and told the student "Payment sent" | `pay()` short-circuits to `rehearse()` on the fake driver: the receipt is written with `simulated = true`, `tx_verified_on_chain = false`, zero allocation and no ledger row. `isReal()` is false for it, and the portal reads "Rehearsal — nothing was sent" |

Overpayment is now derived rather than dropped. `allocateToTuition()` re-reads the account
`lockForUpdate()` and applies `min(amount, remaining)`, recording the excess as
`overpayment_base_units`. The pay form still refuses an over-limit amount; the bucket covers the
race where the debt shrinks after the payer confirmed.

**Still open in B0:** asynchronous provider-handle resolution as a background worker (the
attempt's `accepted`/`unknown` states exist and are readable, but no worker observes them yet),
and student-facing attempt history/status. Live settlement still requires explicit owner
authorization; nothing in this section moved USDC, created or funded a wallet, or enabled a
runtime flag.

#### 14.10.2 One receipt lifecycle, three separate status dimensions

For direct payments, adapt the existing payment transport, exact-money and settlement
primitives; do not create another weaker hash-only verifier. Keep inbound student consent
separate from the outbound staff `PaymentAuthorization` contract.

1. **Prepare and confirm.** Resolve the authenticated student and their payable account,
   institution, payer identity, wallet/control type, treasury destination, `ARC-TESTNET` /
   `5042002`, asset, exact principal and quote/fee ceiling. A pasted payout address proves
   neither ownership nor permission to debit it. Persist the immutable intent and stable
   request key before a signer can run. Student confirmation permits this inbound payment
   only; a background service executes it as a scoped service, never as a fabricated admin.
2. **Submit and observe.** Return the persisted receipt/status ID promptly. A Circle agent
   transaction ID is `accepted`, not a hash; a hash is `awaiting_verification`, not paid.
   Workers resolve handles and verify in the background. Timeout, lost HTTP response or a
   crash after send stays `unknown` with an investigation owner and no new send on retry.
3. **Verify exact movement.** Require successful committed receipt, configured chain/asset,
   matching payer and treasury movement and exact amount, using emitter-specific decimals
   and relayer-safe log evidence as in `ArcSettlementVerifier`. A present/reverted/unrelated
   transaction or an unreadable RPC must not pass. Fake driver records remain simulation,
   never chain-verified receipt or institutional revenue. Quoted fees are not actual fees;
   prove the applicable sender/provider costs separately without assuming who received them.
4. **Allocate/post once.** Under locked account/receipt identity, atomically record verified
   receipt allocation and exact tuition posting. Enforce uniqueness by chain plus transaction
   and movement identifier so two corroborating logs count once and distinct movements are
   not collapsed. Persist recovery state for a successful send whose DB posting failed.
   Concurrent payments cannot over-credit the debt; an excess actual arrival goes to an
   explicit overpayment/liability queue, not a silently dropped transfer or new budget cash.
5. **Reconcile use of funds.** Import the receipt into Collections with an internal source
   link, not a cashier-typed second receipt. Match the payer/account and approved fee category,
   restrictions and original currency. Initially require a separate accounting reviewer for
   financial use of portal receipts; verification of chain movement does not identify legally
   unrestricted tuition income. Unmatched, disputed or restricted items remain non-spendable.
6. **Plan, review, authorize.** A committed eligible collection/review wakes background planning
   once against the approved closed bill set. Jev may label/explain candidates as advice;
   deterministic policy controls budget/cash, and a supervisor accepts or rejects the proposal.
   An eligible exact outgoing reservation still requires independent staff payment approval
   with direct permission and enrolled MFA, unless a separately approved standing mandate
   supplies the required institution-scoped authority. The existing execution blockers remain.

Record these status dimensions independently; one overloaded green “Paid” cannot express them:

| Dimension | Examples | What it never implies |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Transfer | Prepared, awaiting payer confirmation, queued, accepted, awaiting verification, verified, unknown, failed, simulated | A budget allocation or institutional spending authorization |
| Tuition allocation | Not posted, applied to designated pilot account, partially applied, overpayment/unallocated, disputed, separately corrected | Real local-currency tuition paid by testnet funds |
| Finance use | Awaiting reconciliation, reviewed unrestricted in a named real/pilot plane, restricted, suspense, excluded/simulation | New budget, fresh funding approval, permission to change reserves or an outgoing payment |

**Cash counted once:** a current treasury balance already includes received USDC. Never add
the portal's `Transaction.amount`, `StudentTuitionPayment.amount_base_units`, a manual batch
and the observed wallet balance as though they were four inflows. Use either a reviewed
opening-balance-plus-unique-movements roll-forward with an as-of cut, or a current verified
balance net of liabilities/restrictions/reserves/holds, and reconcile the two. Keep original
local-currency collections separate from pilot USDC; no implied FX or duplicate mirror revenue.

**Fees:** student pays only a consented principal plus bounded costs. Store exact six-decimal
principal and exact native fee strings; compare affordability using safe decimal/big-integer
arithmetic, with upward rounding only when required for a six-decimal bound. Unavailable or
malformed fee quotes mean “fee unavailable; payment blocked”, never free. Quote/actual fee,
fee payer, fee scope and any refund liability stay distinct. Sender-paid fees never reduce
the amount credited to the institution or create extra income. A refund is a new, independently
authorized outbound intent to a reviewed destination, not a negative receipt or automatic resend.

#### 14.10.3 Screen behavior after integration

- **Student dashboard / Wallet / Payments:** keep Pay Now and wallet balance. Confirmation
  shows network/mode, institution, exact amount, estimated fee/ceiling and total. After confirm,
  show persistent receipt/status and amount actually applied; unknown means “Checking existing
  payment”, not “Try paying again”. Add tuition receipt history separately from assistance/refunds.
- **Admin → Finance records → Collections:** one workspace with **Student payments** and
  **Cash / bank records**, plus **Needs attention**. These are planned views, not current tabs.
  Portal rows appear automatically with source, payer/account, principal/currency, chain/mode,
  provider handle/hash, movement proof, allocation, restrictions and reviewer/owner. Staff uses
  **Review receipt** for financial reconciliation, never **Approve agent payment** at intake.
  Cashier **Record collection** keeps its three-step upload flow for offchain records only.
- **Finance → Collections:** same institution-scoped receipt/review information and safe actions;
  no navigation into `/admin`. Auditor sees evidence only; viewing cannot create wallets or send.
- **Finance Supervisor:** linked “new receipts”, “what changed”, proposed approved bills,
  deterministic checks and optional Jev advice. Accepting a plan authorizes no transfer.
- **Payment Approvals / Payment Submissions:** preserve exact outgoing approval and read-only
  attempt history. Incoming tuition must not masquerade as an approved vendor payout. A future
  submission shortcut must recheck existing authority rather than grant it or bypass holds.

**Custody decision before scaling:** current student-generated addresses are created under the
operator's Circle CLI account. This demonstrates operator-controlled pilot wallets, not
self-custodial student signing or one independent Circle session per student. Document consent,
operator ability to sign, recovery owner, account deletion/retention and limits. Keep the
reported five-agent-wallet cap/faucet rate limit as deployment constraints to verify with the
provider, not campus-scale economics or a reason to share one payer wallet across students.
Production payer wallets, parent/sponsor identity, lawful collection/custody and real-value
settlement remain separately approved choices. Do not consume wallet slots or migrate custody
merely to demonstrate the UI.

#### 14.10.4 Revised delivery batches

| Batch | Deliverable | Exit evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| B0 — portal safety | Audit existing receipt/posting claims; settle testnet/custody scope; durable student consent/intents/attempts, exact fee policy, strong verification and safe recovery before posting | False/fake/pending/reverted/mismatched observations post no trusted tuition or cash; timeout/crash/replay observes one existing send |
| B1 — unified Collections | Retain delivered cashier capture/review; import verified portal receipts with immutable source/allocation links; prevent overlapping manual/digital capture | One portal payment appears once, no manual re-entry; same receipts cannot inflate opening cash or batch totals; zero-student aggregate plan still works |
| B2 — background coordination | Eligible receipt/review events, after-commit dispatch/recovery, bounded planning and explicit institution service permissions | Reviewed receipts trigger one non-executable closed-set proposal without chat; no receipt event itself creates payment authority |
| B3 — supervision | Student tuition status/history; Collections source/attention views; Finance Supervisor evidence/Jev advice, owned work items and notifications | Student sees truthful transfer/allocation state; authorized staff sees source-to-proposal trace; no cross-student/institution leak or view-only mutation |
| B4 — human execution | Complete source-to-reservation UI and existing async transport/recovery/package gates; preserve MFA-backed payment review and funding controls | One genuine staff approval produces one matching testnet outflow with source attribution; local obligations unchanged; unknown outcomes never resend blindly |
| B5 — standing automation | Independently approved recurring mandate, due occurrence identity, cumulative caps and isolated scheduled execution. Design in **§18**; dependency chain in §18.7 | Scheduler pays one eligible approved occurrence automatically on testnet without chat/per-item click; over-limit valid bill routes to staff and hard failure stays blocked |
| B6 — college evaluation | Permissioned staff demo, background/approval/autonomy evidence and agreed value metrics | Staff confirms usefulness; record baseline, corrections, delays and unresolved cases without claiming bank settlement or production readiness |

**Status as of 2026-10-13.** B0/B1 safety foundations are shipped but their full exit criteria
remain open. The consent snapshot, expiring fee ceiling, chain/purpose/stop guards and
provider-handle no-resend recovery contracts now exist; the outstanding B0 gate is a live
end-to-end run, and on the currently installed Circle CLI the lane **refuses** to sign because
that CLI cannot enforce an accepted sender-fee ceiling. B1 provides explicit staff reconciliation,
not automatic import. B2's reviewed-source binding and committed-work dispatch slice is now
implemented; the automatic coordination target is not yet complete.

**B0 slice delivered 2026-10-13 — immutable consent, bounded fee, no-resend recovery.**

| B0 gate | Closure |
| --- | --- |
| Immutable pre-send consent | `StudentTuitionPaymentIntent` stores a server-minted `request_key` with a `snapshot` + `snapshot_digest` captured before any signer is reachable. `hasValidSnapshot()` re-derives organisation, student, account, wallet, payer, recipient, amount, fee ceiling, total, `ARC-TESTNET`/`5042002`, `USDC`, `plane = pilot`, `purpose = student_tuition_testnet_demo` and expiry-after-quote. Model events refuse updates and deletes. `pay()` requires the client to echo `request_digest` and send an explicit `consent` acceptance bound to fixed `CONSENT_TEXT`; the attempt copies the digest into `consent_snapshot`, and `hasValidConsent()` refuses any drift |
| Expiring quote and accepted fee ceiling | Expiry is re-checked at confirmation **and** inside the submit claim transaction. `fee_ceiling_base_units` is the accepted maximum; preflight re-reads the rail's current fee and refuses a quote above the ceiling, plus a fresh (uncached) balance check against the accepted total. The ceiling rounds UP, so a wallet holding exactly the quoted total is not short |
| Fee ceiling enforced by the signer | `FeeBoundedPaymentTransport::supportsFeeCeiling()` gates submission, and `CircleAgentWalletTransport::submit()` throws when `max_fee_base_units` is present because the installed `circle wallet transfer` exposes no enforceable cap. A `--estimate` is a prediction, not a spending limit, so the lane fails closed before invoking the signer rather than signing unbounded |
| Chain, purpose and stop guards | `assertRail()` refuses a non-testnet chain, a chain-id mismatch, the fake driver, or an installation institution that differs from the intent's. Submission additionally requires `enabled`, an unset `stop_switch`, and `investigation_owner_id` naming a verified-email finance owner who is **not** the payer. Nothing in this lane calls `beginLogin()`/`completeLogin()` |
| No-resend async observation | `submission_started_at` is a write-once fence set inside the claim transaction, and model events forbid a started attempt returning to a dispatchable `prepared`. `provider_handle` (Circle transaction id) and `provider_reference` (chain hash) are separate columns. Only `prepared` may submit; `submitting`/`accepted`/`awaiting_verification`/`unknown` observe the existing handle through `resolve()`, bounded by `max_observations`; a lost handle parks the attempt for operator review. A queue retry re-reads the stored row instead of trusting the job payload |
| Safe recovery | Scheduler recovery (`opensinop:dispatch-student-tuition`) redispatches committed consent and observes existing attempts. Observation fails closed when observation is disabled. Posting is idempotent under a row lock with a unique `movement_key`/`request_key`, and a committed consent survives queue failure. Verified evidence, the fee, the verification time and `posted_at` are write-once |
| Truthful student view | Transfer state, chain hash and fee are shown separately from allocation; the dashboard and `GET student/tuition/attempts` read persisted attempts only, and no GET, reload or poll can submit. Testnet is labelled as a pilot that does not pay official college tuition, and a lost response tells the payer to inspect existing attempts rather than create a new payment |
| Pilot receipt is not official revenue | The inbound path writes **no** `Transaction` row and credits no float treasury. Verified movement produces only a pilot allocation against a designated testnet-designated account |

**Still open in B0.** A live end-to-end verified run needs a rail that can enforce the accepted
fee ceiling — the installed CLI cannot, so the transport refuses and no testnet money has been
moved by this slice. That capability, a provider-configured wallet, an independent audit of
pre-hardening records and any real student consent all require explicit owner authorization.
`EDUFLOW_TUITION_SUBMISSION_ENABLED` and `EDUFLOW_TUITION_OBSERVATION_ENABLED` both default off,
so nothing dispatches until an operator turns them on.

**Automatic intake delivered 2026-10-13 — unattended reconciliation, strictly stricter than the staff button.**

| Intake property | Closure |
| --- | --- |
| Off by default and separately authorised | `EDUFLOW_TUITION_AUTO_INTAKE` gates both the wake and the sweep. Turning it on is an operator decision, not a consequence of the consent work above |
| Stricter than staff reconciliation | Automated intake additionally requires a **verified attempt** — `student_tuition_payment_attempt_id` with intact `settlement_evidence`, consent digest, hash, chain, sender, recipient and exact amount. The legacy `tx_verified_on_chain` flag alone is refused, because the planner refuses it too and an unattended row nobody can use is noise at best |
| A named maker, never the payer | `EDUFLOW_TUITION_INTAKE_OWNER_ID` must name a verified-email `finance_officer`/`admin`/`super_admin` account, and never the student who paid. `prepared_by` records it, so maker/checker separation applies unchanged: the owner cannot review the receipt it caused |
| One derived identity per movement | The capture key is a UUIDv5 of `payment.movement_key`, not a generated UUID. A replay reproduces the identical receipt, and no sweep tick can mint a second identity for one settlement |
| Deliverable and recoverable | Posting registers an after-commit wake, and `opensinop:reconcile-tuition-receipts` redelivers committed settlements no receipt covers. A rollback discards the wake with the transaction; a broker outage, an undeliverable dispatch or a flag that was off at posting time leaves the payment committed and owed, not lost |
| Still no authority | An automatically reconciled receipt arrives unreviewed: `receipts_reviewed => false`, zero unrestricted cash, `can_execute => false`. Reconciliation still writes no `Transaction` and credits no float treasury |

**B1 delivered 2026-10-12 (unified Collections).** `ImportTuitionPaymentAsCollection` reconciles a
verified movement into an immutable `CollectionBatch`. It reconciles rather than records: the money
already arrived, so it writes no `Transaction`, touches no balance, and its restricted portion is the
payment's overpayment.

| B1 requirement | Closure |
| --- | --- |
| Import verified portal receipts with an immutable source link | `collection_batches.student_tuition_payment_id`, nullable and **unique** — one payment reconciles at most once, and a receipt with no link cannot claim movement evidence. `hasValidSnapshot()` re-derives the movement digest and the recorded hash/amount/request key from the live payment, so a snapshot claiming one movement while linking another fails |
| Prevent overlapping manual/digital capture | Three independent guards: the unique movement digest occupying the existing `source_document_digest` slot; `CaptureCollectionBatch` refusing `CollectionBatch::TUITION_PORTAL_STREAM` as a manual channel; and refusing any `source_reference` that is a settled payment's `tx_hash` — the realistic double-count, where a cashier holding the Arc explorer hash types it as the receipt number |
| One portal payment appears once | Replay under the same `capture_key` returns the existing receipt; a fresh identity is refused as already reconciled; the unique index holds even if a future caller reaches past the action |
| Same receipts cannot inflate opening cash or batch totals | Reconciling never credits a balance or writes a `Transaction`; overpayment is restricted. B2 schema v3 derives the total of selected movement receipts and requires `opening_funds = 0` whenever it is nonzero. Other opening funds retain their staff-attestation contract; arbitrary manual receipt overlap or a bank reconciliation is not thereby proven |
| Zero-student aggregate plan still works | A cashier receipt with no students, no wallets and no gateways is unaffected; the manual path and its attestations are unchanged |
| Separate accounting reviewer | Unchanged and required. Reconciling creates no authority: `evidence()` reports `receipts_reviewed => false` and `can_execute => false`, and the existing policy, model hook and unique review row keep maker-checker separation |

Scoping note: an installation is single-organization by construction (`InstallationInstitution::current()`
returns null unless exactly one organization exists), so the boundary for "is this our money" is
`recipient_address` matching `config('lepton.arc.treasury')` — not a per-student organization filter.

**B2 slice delivered 2026-10-13 — reviewed-source planning and queue wake.**

- `ReviewedCollections` derives each bound entry's `movement_receipt_minor_units` from its
  actual `CollectionBatch` origin. `CaptureBudgetSnapshot` writes schema v3 and an exact
  `movement_receipts_minor_units` sum using `BigInteger`, never `array_sum()`/floats. The
  snapshot validates that sum, and planning re-derives the entries from source and review.
- Conservative overlap policy: any plan counting a movement receipt must use zero typed
  opening funds. This is a deliberately restrictive exclusion, not a computed opening balance
  or a reconciled roll-forward for pre-existing cash. Staff-attested PHP/other non-movement
  plans, including USDC plans using only opening funds, retain their existing behavior.
- Source and liability bindings remain live: changing imported allocation/restrictions makes
  the receipt fail integrity checks. Unreviewed, held, rejected, mismatched-currency or future
  receipts remain ineligible; a selected overpayment remains deducted as restricted cash.
- Planning requires a matching verified attempt (request, student/account/wallet, hash,
  sender/recipient, exact principal, verification time and `ARC-TESTNET`/`5042002`) and a
  complete applied/overpayment split. Historical `tx_verified_on_chain` alone is refused.
  This prevents automatic promotion of pre-hardening records; it does not replace B0's
  remaining independent chain audit of historical records or a live verified run. Immutable
  proof storage and no-resend recovery are supplied by the B0 slice above.
- `DepartmentBudgetPlanner`, recovery sweeper, funding-window context and dashboard evidence
  labels accept schema v3. Funding capacity remains the **minimum**, never the sum, of reviewed
  planning cash and observed balance net of protected funds. No wallet/transaction is credited.
- New staff-bound budget capture wakes its unique `budget:<snapshot id>` run **after commit**.
  Review wakes/completes the receipt's own `collection:<batch id>` work item, preserving any
  earlier immutable result. Capture/review replay and sweeper share a two-minute dispatch lease.
  Queue delivery can retry; this is one logical proposal identity, not exactly-once transport.
- Direct wake and sweep both refuse sync/non-durable queues and `retry_after <= 30`. A wake
  failure cannot undo committed evidence: it is reported, retains durable work/error state,
  and scheduler can recover after the lease. Rollback discards both work and after-commit wake.
- Legacy v2 staff-attested snapshots replay without rewriting their digest. Legacy v2 plans
  binding digital movements remain readable history but must be freshly captured as v3 before
  financial use, because they lack the new overlap evidence. No records are migrated or corrected.

**Live inbound settlement demonstrated 2026-10-13.** The bill lane ran end to end on real
ARC-TESTNET: 5.000000 USDC from a generated student wallet to the treasury, `0xa8e7aeff…`,
verified on chain and allocated against the bill. Juan's wallet moved 20.0 → 15.0 and the
treasury 64.9 → 69.9 — **exactly 5.0 in each direction, zero fee**, which confirmed the
relayed-sponsorship finding on an inbound transfer as well as the three outbound ones. The
bill moved `open` → `paid` and **no `Transaction` row was written**, so a testnet receipt is
still not institutional revenue. This is the first genuinely verified student payment in the
project; §17 step 12 remains undemonstrated for the **outbound** vendor lane.

**Still open in B2/B3:** an explicit institution-scoped,
approved planning context mapping incoming receipts to an existing allocation/closed bill set;
receipt/review-triggered successor-plan capture; supervisor-side Collections source/attention
views and investigation ownership surfaces. A receipt review cannot refresh an
already bound plan here: snapshots bind reviews only after approval, and both snapshots and
reviews are immutable. Automatically selecting a budget or widening its bill set would invent
authority. This slice therefore wakes the plan on its staff-authorized capture and does not
claim receipt approval alone produces a new proposal. Async provider observation, no-resend
recovery, automatic receipt import and the student-side bill screen with advisory
classification now exist; the staff-side approval surface does not.

All verification uses isolated factories/stubs. Runtime flags, live funds, wallet provisioning,
official tuition records and existing operational financial history are not modified by this slice.

Do B0 before promoting merged digital records; then B1–B3 connect intake to the existing
supervised flow. B4's unresolved outbound attempt/package/fee issues may be investigated
read-only in parallel, but inbound UI cannot bypass them. Existing historical payment records
stay intact unless a separately authorized, append-only correction is reviewed.

**Direct-payment example, separate from real PHP below:** a designated pilot student account
pays `5.000000 USDC` plus a consented bounded fee. Provider accepts the intent; only matching
verified movement creates its one digital receipt and allocation. Staff initially reviews
category/restrictions; that receipt can then feed a USDC pilot plan within an existing approved
allocation. If the treasury's latest balance already contains the 5 USDC, do not add it again.
Jev does not divide that 5 USDC into new percentages or choose a new beneficiary. Actual
outgoing bill payment still waits for its exact authorized workflow; the real PHP account
and the student's official college receipt are unaffected by this testnet demonstration.

**Hypothetical walkthrough; figures are not defaults:** cashier reconciles `PHP 50,000.00`
of tuition receipts, including `PHP 10,000.00` restricted funds. Separate reviewer confirms
source and restrictions. With no opening funds, outflows or other commitments, and protected
reserve `PHP 15,000.00`, local available cash is `PHP 25,000.00`. Approved department allocation
is independently `PHP 20,000.00`; neither number is the Circle wallet balance. A background
planning run observes the review without anyone asking it a question and considers existing
approved bills within those two limits. It never chooses a new percentage split of tuition.

For an approved recurring internet bill of `PHP 1,000.00`, a separately approved hypothetical
mirror rate `50 PHP per USDC` gives `20.000000 USDC`. If a current standing mandate permits
that exact obligation/destination, at most `25.000000 USDC` per occurrence plus a separately
bounded fee, and cumulative limits/reservations/actual testnet funds all pass, the future
executor may submit its one testnet payment without a new approval click. Record standing
mandate authority visibly. No conversion of tuition or local bill settlement is claimed.
Another approved one-off laboratory bill goes to a supervisor; insufficient budget, altered
recipient or restricted use stays blocked regardless of bill size. Notify the responsible
staff and retain the reason/evidence; do not make an urgent label bypass controls.

Required additional acceptance tests:
- Direct confirmation is scoped to one payer/student/account/institution and designated
  pilot network; forged recipients, foreign accounts and unowned signing wallets are refused.
  UI cannot show fake/testnet receipt as real tuition clearance or hide a failed verification.
- Verify receipt success, chain/asset, sender/recipient and amount, including relayer envelopes,
  emitter decimals and corroborating logs. Transaction presence, hash alone, null/pending RPC,
  reverted receipts, mismatches and fake gateway cannot produce trusted paid/confirmed posting.
- Stable request identity survives double-click, refreshed page, duplicated worker, lost HTTP
  response, crash before/after send and DB failure after settlement. Resolve existing handle/hash;
  never generate a new send merely because no final row exists. Concurrent partial payments
  and overpayment arrivals preserve every receipt and cannot over-credit tuition.
- Fee quote failure blocks rather than becomes zero. Exact six-decimal principal plus native
  fees is affordable only within consented ceiling; precision/overflow, stale quote, fee drift,
  cached balance drift and invalid currency/network cannot turn an estimate into actual cost.
- Portal receipt, manual cashier report and opening/current balance cannot count the same
  receipt twice. Unique source links survive event replay; restricted/suspense/simulated money
  contributes zero eligible real planning cash. Verified testnet receipts can contribute only
  to explicitly designated pilot USDC capacity, never local/production cash. Principal and
  sender-paid fees are separate.
- Rollback emits no planning event; committed digital receipt/review reaches Collections and
  the correct supervisor once with no open browser. Notification dismissal never reviews a
  receipt, accepts a plan, creates a mandate or approves payment.
- Generated-wallet slot reservation and interrupted creation recover the correct provider
  identity; view-only staff cannot provision/sign, and parent/sponsor payer is not inferred
  from a student login. Existing generic aggregate planning still works with zero students.
- Cashier maker cannot self-verify collections or authorize spending; accountant read access
  does not imply payment permission; institution/service identity survives queued execution.
- Events after rollback produce no work; committed events survive broker failure through
  recovery sweep. Duplicate/out-of-order events and multiple scheduler instances do not
  duplicate proposals, alerts, reservations, occurrence fulfilment or payment attempts.
- With browser closed and no user prompt, reviewed collections produce a plan, a due scan
  opens eligible work and a review-required item reaches the correct supervisor inbox.
- Approval waits consume no occupied worker or repeated model call. Delivery failure retries
  notification only; stale links, duplicate decisions and unanswered reminders cannot release funds.
- Same occurrence triggered by chat, import, due scan and retry is fulfilled once. Boundary,
  cumulative/period limits, price/destination drift, revocation, expiry, insufficient reserve,
  stop switch and catch-up backlog behave correctly under concurrent workers.
- AI disabled/unavailable or malicious document instructions cannot alter exact amounts,
  beneficiaries, policy, authority, scheduling privileges, caps or signing access; autonomous
  deterministic lane remains testable without an LLM.
- Pause prevents new submissions but allows reconciliation. A restart/timeout after provider
  acceptance recovers existing attempt; unknown outcome retains capacity until resolved.
- Dashboard scopes financial data and fake/network labels correctly, reports stale/failed
  heartbeats honestly and distinguishes planning completion from verified settlement.

These remain acceptance targets, not a claim that the merged portal or legacy demo passes
them. Existing fake-path and endpoint tests are useful regressions but not proof of matching
live tuition settlement, digital-to-Collections integration, custody, or recurring execution.
No payment path is enabled or disabled by this plan update.

## 15. Counterparty Wallets — Payer Control, Pilot Wallets and Missing Integration

**Status revised 2026-10-12:** PR #14 implements operator-provisioned student wallet records,
balance views and a tuition send/record path. It does **not** establish student self-custody,
legally attributed third-party receipts, safe receipt reconciliation or production collection.
The production roles below remain design targets; §14.10 now governs integration of the
merged pilot wallet flow. Vendor recipients remain reviewed operator-controlled testnet aliases.

### 15.1 The honest answer to "what do counterparties hold today?"

There are now both institution wallet records and `StudentWallet` records. The important
distinction is **who can sign**, not which table contains an address. Student generation
uses the installation operator's Circle CLI account; linking that address to a student
does not establish independent control by the student or a separate custodian account.

| Leg | Current state | Why |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Institution **outbound** (agent pays a vendor) | Structurally designed, deliberately simulated | `VendorDestinationVersion` binds a reviewed address, but §14.3.5 requires that address to be an **operator-controlled testnet recipient** mapped to a vendor *alias*. The real vendor holds nothing and receives nothing. |
| Institution **inbound** (a payer funds the institution) | Student tuition safety foundations under §14.10 | Movement checks, attempt/receipt records, fake-driver exclusion, immutable quote/consent, write-once settlement proof, async handle observation and no-resend recovery exist. B1 provides explicit staff reconciliation plus an off-by-default unattended intake that requires verified attempt proof; B2 binds approved matching-attempt pilot receipts into a staff-selected schema v3 plan with opening-funds exclusion. Receipt-to-budget routing, staff-side attention views, an independent audit of historical records and a live verified run remain open. Generic §12.5 collection intents/suspense and legal payer identity remain unbuilt. |
| Student | Wallet/balance page and operator-generated Circle address available | `Student.payout_address` now drives common reads and can match a generated `StudentWallet`. It is still not proof that the student independently controls signing. |
| Vendor | A free-text alias plus a reviewed address | `Vendor.wallet_address` is legacy master data. The reviewed path is `VendorDestinationVersion`, whose address is operator-controlled during the pilot. |

OpenSinop now has entry points for both legs, but **an inbound send UI is not a completed
reconciled collection workflow**. Proving tuition intake requires matching settlement and
one safe allocation, then separately making the receipt eligible for planning. Proving a
vendor outflow still requires genuine staff authority and matching settlement. Neither leg
proves production custody, fiat settlement or actual college/vendor receipt from testnet funds.

### 15.2 Wallet roles, and who holds the key

Every address the system touches has exactly one role and one custody answer. Conflating
them is how an agent ends up signing for someone else's funds.

| # | Role | Key holder | Who can move funds | OpenSinop stores | Can the model touch it |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | **Institution reserve** | Institution, human 2-of-2 MPC (Circle Agent Wallet) | Named humans only, with OTP | Provider/account id, address, chain, custody attestation, recovery owner | **Never** |
| 2 | **Institution operational** | Institution, human 2-of-2 MPC | Named humans; the agent may submit a bounded, authorized intent | Same, plus allowance, policy ceiling and funded amount | Proposes only; cannot sign, change limits or move funds |
| 3 | **Gateway deposit** | Circle Gateway contract | Delegates over deposited balance | Transfer id/spec hash, source/destination chain, fees, recovery state | **Never** (delegate scope is balance-wide, not a departmental cap) |
| 4 | **Counterparty destination** | **The counterparty or its custodian — never the institution** | The counterparty | Reviewed, versioned destination with a *type* and its own verification predicate | Proposes an intent against it; cannot create, rotate or control it |
| 5 | **Payer source** | **The payer (or their custodian) — never the institution** | The payer | Opaque reference + verified inbound observation, attribution evidence | **Never** |
| 6 | **Operator-provisioned student pilot wallet** (merged) | Circle wallet is created in the operator's signing/account context; independent student key ownership is not established | Current web payment path requests the operator-held gateway to sign after authenticated student action | `StudentWallet`, payout address, generated/funding provenance and tuition-payment record | **Never**; cannot generate, fund, sign or authorize collection |

Roles 1–5 above describe intended production custody boundaries, not a claim of implemented
independent wallets or exact Circle key topology. Role 6 is an explicit pilot exception and
must not be presented as role 5 or silently converted into real-value custody.

Rules that follow:

- **Do not claim non-custody merely because a wallet is labelled “student”.** Production
  roles 4/5 are controlled by the counterparty or approved custodian; current role 6 is not.
  Real-value operator custody requires explicit product/legal/provider approval, consent,
  safeguarding and recovery design before release, not a change to a button's label.
- **Pilot wallet provisioning now exists outside `WalletGateway`.** `CircleAgentWalletCli`
  wraps the package's argv runner for create/fund/list/estimate. Keep its audit, permissions,
  consent, slot bounds and recovery duties explicit. Never synthesize an address or let an
  LLM provision a wallet; do not describe operator-created addresses as third-party owners.
- **An institution-operated address standing in for a vendor is role 4 only in appearance.**
  While a vendor alias maps to an operator-controlled testnet recipient, the system must
  label it as simulation on every surface — dashboard, export, screenshot and audit — and
  must never describe it as the vendor being paid.

### 15.3 Topology

```

The operator-provisioned student leg is a testnet integration, not independent payer custody.
Verified receipt/allocation integration into the institution's evidence ledger remains open;
generic external payer collection is still proposed. Outgoing vendor aliases remain simulation.

### 15.4 Why a single institution wallet cannot substitute for counterparty wallets

Three independent reasons, each sufficient on its own:

1. **Custody.** A vendor's invoice is payable to *that vendor's* legally controlled
   account. An institution-held address cannot receive it; the institution would be paying
   itself and then carrying a vendor payable as an internal balance — which is a different
   product with its own credit, liquidity and licensing consequences.
2. **Attribution.** §12.5.2 establishes that a sender address does not identify a legal payer.
   Movement between operator-provisioned wallets can be proved onchain, but does not prove
   independent student/parent ownership, consent or externally sourced college income.
   Preserve pilot provenance rather than matching internal demo funding as third-party revenue.
3. **Attestation.** Circle's 2-of-2 Agent Wallet means each counterparty address has a human
   and a device behind it. Per-student Agent Wallets (§15.6) are therefore operationally
   out of reach at enrolment scale, and the wallet-count limits and per-user cost are
   explicitly unverified (§12.2). An institution cannot enrol a department, let alone a
   campus, on unverified per-person custody economics. PR #14 reports five agent wallets per
   chain and uses one signing context; recheck provider limits and do not assume that design
   supplies independent per-student signers or scales to college enrollment.

### 15.5 Outbound — how a vendor actually receives payment

A vendor's settlement destination is **not a bare address string**. It is a discriminated
record with a type, because the type determines the evidence required to call it settled
and determines who is exposed if it is wrong.

| Type | Who holds the funds | Verified settlement predicate | Friction | Appropriate for |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `self_custody_address` | Vendor's own Arc address | Successful Arc movement to the reviewed address + finality | Vendor must already hold USDC and control a key | Vendors already inside a stablecoin economy |
| `custodian_account` | A licensed exchange/custodian | Provider callback or statement tied to a transfer identity, **not** Arc finality alone | Vendor needs an account and KYC; institution buys USDC from a custodian | Realistic for most domestic vendors |
| `payout_partner_account` | A regulated payout/off-ramp provider | Payout API idempotency key, provider reference and bank credit | Requires an approved partner, jurisdiction review and an FX quote | Vendors who insist on local bank money |
| `internal_ledger_credit` | Nobody — an institution-side payable | **Never settled on any rail** | None on-chain | Vendors paid through the existing bank process, which the pilot is actually doing |
| `pilot_testnet_alias` | The institution operator | Arc testnet movement to an approved recipient | Simulation only | Section 14 hackathon, permanently labelled simulation |

Three rules that the type discriminator makes enforceable:

- **The settlement predicate is type-specific.** An `approve_payment` authorization and a
  verified Arc receipt settle a `self_custody_address`. They do **not** settle a
  `custodian_account` or `payout_partner_account`, where the evidence is provider-side and
  must be reconciled separately. A future implementation must never let an on-chain receipt
  close a fiat-payout obligation.
- **A destination-type change is a new version requiring independent review and a
  cooling-off period**, not an edit. Changing `custodian_account` → `self_custody_address`
  is a change of who can lose the money and must clear maker/checker like any other
  destination change (§12.6).
- **Suspension is first-class.** Destination suspension, cooling-off and control-evidence
  recertification are named open work in §12.2. An unrecertified destination blocks new
  holds; it must not merely warn.

**Recommended order:** ship `internal_ledger_credit` and `pilot_testnet_alias` first
(the pilot needs nothing else), then `self_custody_address` for institutions whose vendors
are already on-chain, and treat `custodian_account` and `payout_partner_account` as
separately reviewed integrations with their own jurisdiction gates (§8.5). Never make
`payout_partner_account` the default on the assumption that an off-ramp will exist.

### 15.6 Inbound — how a payer actually funds the institution

The merged tuition path identifies a `Student`, their generated wallet and tuition account.
This is useful application attribution but still conflates two legally distinct parties:

- **`Student`** — the beneficiary of the education. Usually not a contracting party. In
  jurisdictions where minors cannot contract, a student's fee obligation is the *payer's*
  legal liability.
- **`Payer`** — the person or entity that owns the funds, signs, pays, and is credited.
  Frequently a parent, frequently a different person from the `Student` row, and sometimes a
  employer, sponsor or scholarship fund.

`Student.payout_address` alone cannot identify the person entitled to dispose of funds.
Before production inbound collection, introduce explicit payer/control/consent evidence linked
to student and institution. A parent/sponsor and a student are not interchangeable. For the
current testnet slice, record the operator-controlled pilot source and authenticated student
action truthfully instead of inventing a legal payer or claiming student self-custody.

| Model | Who holds the address | Attribution | Blocker |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **A. Existing channel, cashier-recorded** (the pilot) | Nobody; the bank holds it | Staff-verified aggregate receipts | None — already the Section 14 path. Receipts never become Arc funds |
| **B. Institution-custodial credit** | Institution ledger only | Exact internal posting | Not a payment and not a rail (§6.1). Must never be labelled USDC settlement |
| **C. Aggregated processor / Gateway collection** | One institution address | Per-payer reference inside a single verified inbound | Needs the §12.5 inbox, then a processor contract. **Lowest per-payer friction** |
| **D. Payer self-custody** | Payer's own Agent Wallet / address | Payer-supplied opaque reference | 2-of-2 MPC per payer; enrolment, KYC, minors, devices, unverified wallet-count and cost limits |
| **E. Operator-generated student pilot wallet** (merged) | Operator's Circle context | Student/account FK and generated address | Hardening and financial reconciliation under §14.10; testnet only, no proof of independent payer custody or campus scalability |

**Recommendation, in order:** A (already proven for the pilot) → C, because it gives each
payer a real USDC receipt while the institution operates exactly one address and one
counterparty relationship → B, which is useful and cheap but must never be called
settlement → D only where a payer already holds USDC and asks for it. Retain E as the merged
bounded testnet demonstration and connect it safely; do not silently turn that implementation
into the default production custody model. A remains fully supported without student records.

Inbound invariants that must hold regardless of model:

- An unrecognised inbound transfer enters **unallocated/suspense** and nothing more
  (§12.5.4). A matching reference is correlation, not authorization.
- A payer-uploaded receipt, an expected fee, or a pending bank transfer is **not cash** and
  cannot increase spendable funds.
- The institution never refunds to an unverified address; refunds use a separately reviewed
  outbound intent against a currently reviewed destination (§12.5.5).
- Charging a student in USDC does not create a new fee policy, change tuition amounts, or
  convert the college's existing statutory accounts. §13.5 and §6.1 still govern.

### 15.7 Data model consequences

Current records express part of the flow. Remaining gaps must stay visible:

| Gap | Today | Required shape |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Wallet roles | Organization `Wallet` plus student-linked `StudentWallet` now exist; table linkage does not establish custody | Explicit role/custody/control/readiness and reviewed signer identity across existing records. Do not force a migration to one table or invent a second monetary balance to make schemas look uniform |
| Counterparty identity | `Vendor` has a bare `wallet_address`; no legal-entity type | `Vendor` needs a legal-entity type; the address moves to a versioned destination record |
| Destination type | `VendorDestinationVersion` records an address and chain only | Add a **destination type** and bind the type-specific evidence required by §15.5 |
| Settlement evidence | Verdict is Arc-shaped (`verified`/`fabricated`/`unverifiable`/`ledger_only`) | The predicate must become type-specific; an Arc receipt cannot close a custodian or payout obligation |
| Payer | No concept; `Student.payout_address` conflates payer and beneficiary | Explicit `Payer` linked to institution, with its own identity, consent and destination evidence |
| Inbound | `StudentTuitionPayment` and direct API/UI, without durable pre-send intent or safe verified allocation | Stable incoming intent/attempt identity, strong receipt proof, exactly-once allocation and source-linked Collections/suspense. Generic §12.5 intake remains proposed |
| Counterparty ownership | `Wallet` has `organization_id`; role 4/5 rows have no legitimate institution FK semantics | Counterparty destinations are **not** institution wallets. Referencing them through `wallets` would imply custody the institution does not have |

The narrow integrity/receipt linkage in §14.10 is now integration work for the merged portal.
Generic production custody, legal payer onboarding and broader rail integrations remain later
institution-release work. Do not redesign unrelated tables before the safe tuition slice passes.

### 15.8 What this changes, and what it does not

- **Section 14 keeps its one-department spending scope but adds an optional intake path.**
  Cashier-recorded local receipts and operator-provisioned testnet student payments remain
  separate economic sources, reconciled in one workspace. Vendor recipients remain reviewed
  testnet aliases. No production collection, mainnet signing or unrestricted treasury authority
  follows from the portal merge.
- **No dashboard, screen or table claims a counterparty has been paid.** A verified mirror
  transfer settles an on-chain intent to a testnet alias; it is not a vendor receipt, not a
  collection, and not college income (§14.3.6).
- **Two product claims become explicitly conditional** in Section 6.1's capability table:
  "receivables and inbound matching" requires §12.5 plus a payer identity; "vendor bills"
  require a counterparty destination type and its matching settlement predicate.
- **A future "OpenSinop pays any vendor in USDC" claim is not supportable from this codebase**
  without either an approved payout partner or counterparties who already hold USDC. Both are
  named in §13.5 as not proved.

### 15.9 Decisions this section requires

1. Whether the institution release may ship **model C (aggregated collection)** at all, or
   whether inbound stays staff-recorded indefinitely. This is the single decision that
   determines whether OpenSinop is ever a two-legged system.
2. Whether `custodian_account` / `payout_partner_account` are in scope for any target
   jurisdiction, and who owns that integration and its compliance review.
3. Whether an institution-custodial ledger product is explicitly out of scope. This section
   assumes it is; saying so prevents it being built by accident.
4. Confirm that `Student.payout_address` is legacy and will be superseded by an explicit
   `Payer`, rather than being reused for the inbound path.

## 16. Delivered Dashboards — Admin Installation Console and Finance Supervisor

**Status: implemented and tested 2026-10-10.** 1282 Pest tests pass (3 skipped). This
section records what shipped so a later session does not rediscover it or mistake a
delivered surface for a design proposal. **No payment path was enabled by this work.**

### 16.1 What changed

| Before | After |
| --- | --- |
| `/finance` returned 404 — no dashboard existed | `App\Filament\Pages\FinanceDashboard` is the panel root |
| Finance panel had **zero** widgets and **no** theme | 8 stat/table widgets, 4 charts, dedicated `resources/css/filament/finance/theme.css` |
| Admin dashboard titled "Autonomous Financial Operator", offered **"Record Tuition Revenue (+10,000 USDC)"** which wrote a ledger row with no chain transfer | Title "Installation & operations"; the fabricated-revenue action is removed |
| Admin dashboard rendered **every** registered widget, putting activity-log heatmaps beside settlement figures | Widget list pinned explicitly in `Dashboard::getWidgets()` |
| `TreasuryOverviewWidget` summed float invoice amounts and reported "AI Autonomy" as though a payment lane were running | Rewritten as "Money posture": counts evidence records and resolved decisions instead of balances |
| `Approval Center` banner read "Human-in-the-Loop Safeguard Active" | "Legacy Approval Center" with a banner stating it is **not** the authorized vendor payment route |
| Admin nav group `Financial Operations` duplicated the finance panel's meaning | Renamed `Finance records`; explicit `navigationGroups()` on both panels |

### 16.2 Finance supervisor: one widget per §14.9 requirement

| Widget / chart | §14.9 bullet | Design rule it encodes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `ApprovalInboxWidget` | Approval inbox | Three authorities listed **separately** — receipt review, plan acceptance, payment authorization are different acts held by different people |
| `CollectionsOverviewWidget` | Collections by source/currency | Evidence buckets, never one "available balance" total: unreviewed and restricted money cannot fund a plan |
| `CollectionsTrendChart` | (same) | Stacked by review state so a reviewer can see the spendable segment; bars keyed by **currency as well as day**, because stacking two currencies would be an unauthorised conversion |
| `BudgetCapacityWidget` | Allocation vs local cash | `BudgetSnapshot::headroom()` exact strings; budget and cash headroom never merged; schema-v1 attestation badged apart from reviewed v2 bindings |
| `BudgetHeadroomChart` | (same) | Allocation and cash plotted as two series because they legitimately disagree |
| `ArcSettlementWidget` | Arc balance/fees/network/freshness/fake | Block-bound exact observation, 18-decimal native gas rendered from a string, `is_fake` stated in the stat body, stale never silently refreshed |
| `WorkflowRunWidget` | Work by logical run | Logical worker, triggering event, affected document, state, heartbeat staleness, next run, actionable error. A run is not a payment |
| `WorkflowRunStateChart` | (same) | Makes "nothing to do" distinguishable from "worker is dead" |
| `AutonomyLaneWidget` | Automatic lane | Reports `None approved` / `Zero allowance` and `0 auto-authorized · 0 submitted · 0 verified · 0 held` as the zeros they are. Deliberately **unlinked** — no mandate screen exists (§18) |
| `EvidenceTimelineWidget` | Evidence-linked timeline | Recorded rule results and public summaries only; stops visibly at "No executor is shipped" |
| `PaymentDecisionChart` | (same) | Approved + rejected + held together — approval-as-is rate needs the whole denominator (§14.6) |
| `OperationsHealthWidget` | Operations health | Queue depth, heartbeat, stale funding, unread notifications, provider reachability, unresolved outcomes — a stopped worker and an idle one must not look alike |

### 16.3 Admin installation console

`InstallationReadinessWidget` reports institution identity, the single-institution boundary
and its fail-closed behaviour, onboarding gate state (registration/impersonation), rail
binding and driver/fake label, AI posture and background runtime state.
`AdoptionActivityChart` plots finance-domain record creation per day over 14 days — an
operator's answer to "is the school actually running this?" without opening the finance
panel.

### 16.4 Navigation contract encoded in the dashboards

- **Finance widgets link only within `/finance`** (Collections, Finance Supervisor, Payment
  Reviews, plus ArcScan in a new tab). A finance → admin link would expose the admin console
  to finance staff and is a privilege escalation.
- **Admin widgets may link into `/finance`** — the safe direction.
- A panel or chart heading is an anchor, not a label (`App\Filament\Support\LinkedHeading`,
  styled `fi-finance-heading-link` in both themes). Where no management page exists, the
  control is left **unlinked** rather than pointed at something unrelated.
- Charts cross into float only through `Money::toChartValue()`, which exists solely to feed
  Chart.js. The exact figure stays authoritative in the table beside each chart and is
  never stored, persisted or authorized from the chart value.

### 16.5 Supporting model and DTO additions

`Money::formatExact()` (exact base units beyond `PHP_INT_MAX`) and `Money::toChartValue()`
(chart-only float edge) on `App\DTOs\Money`. Relations added because the dashboards need
them and they were missing: `PaymentIntent::{reservation, financePolicyVersion,
vendorDestinationVersion, invoiceVersionReview}`, `CollectionBatch::preparer`,
`BudgetSnapshot::budget`. Tests: `tests/Feature/Filament/FinanceSupervisorDashboardTest.php`
and the reworked `OpenSinopCommandCenterTest`.

### 16.6 Current screen availability and remaining work (2026-10-13)

Backend records, visible screens and end-to-end payment acceptance are three separate delivery
claims. Current routes and page actions establish the following, not universal admin availability:

| Capability | `/admin` | `/finance` | Remaining limitation |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Installation/operations overview, identity, providers and staff | Available | Not the finance role | Readiness/configuration is not settlement proof |
| Exact reserved-payment review and independent reviewer enrollment | **Automation → Payment Approvals** (`/admin/payment-reviews`) | **Payment Approvals** (`/finance/payment-reviews`) | Requires direct `AuthorizePayment:PaymentIntent`, verified eligible staff, independently enrolled current factor and maker/checker separation; review does not itself transfer |
| Submission queue/history, provider detail and attempts | **Automation → Payment Submissions** (`/admin/payment-submissions`), read-only | No submission resource registered | Unknown outcomes need investigation; a hash or provider ID is not verified settlement |
| Aggregate collection capture and independent source review | **Finance records → Collections** (`/admin/collections`) | **Collections** (`/finance/collections`) | Cashier-friendly three-step capture with private receipt/report upload and independent review; `Reconcile student payment` imports a verified movement as a source-linked receipt exactly once (B1), and an off-by-default unattended intake can do the same for movements that carry verified attempt proof |
| Student wallet balance/provenance and wallet generation | **Student Services → Students → View student**, wallet widget | No corresponding wallet-management screen registered | Operator-generated Circle wallets; generation/control/consent permissions and slot recovery need §14.10 review. Balance is a read, not a tuition receipt |
| Direct student tuition quote/pay | Generic **Transactions** may show `tuition_revenue`; **Tuition Accounts** may reflect its current posting; no dedicated tuition-attempt/reconciliation inbox | Eligible posted payments can be manually reconciled in Collections; approved receipt reviews can be selected in Finance Supervisor budget capture | Student entry is `/student/dashboard` Pay Now plus `/student/wallet`. Immutable quote/consent, expiring fee ceiling, chain/purpose/stop guards and provider-handle no-resend recovery exist (B0 slice). Submission stays off by default and the installed Circle CLI cannot enforce a fee ceiling, so the rail refuses before invoking a signer. Generic confirmed status is not proof |
| Student tuition receipt history and intake exceptions | No dedicated resource found | No dedicated queue found | `StudentTuitionPayment` records exist; `/payments` still lists assistance/refunds. Student-side attempt history now exists on the student dashboard and at `GET student/tuition/attempts` |
| Non-tuition student bills, advisory classification and payment progress | No dedicated resource found | No dedicated queue found | **`/student/bills` shipped**: bill list, exact-amount quote, digest-bound consent, live submission state polled from persisted rows only, and Jev's advisory read fetched on demand. Classification is display-only and cannot authorise a spend; no GET can submit. Staff-side approval surface is still absent, so an escalated bill has no queue to land in |
| Closed-set budget capture, background run evidence and plan review | No dedicated admin screen | **Finance Supervisor** (`/finance/finance-supervisor`) | Schema v3 supports selected independently reviewed movement receipts, zero typed opening funds when counting them, and after-commit planning wake. Staff still captures the closed set; no automatic receipt-to-budget routing. Accepting a plan never grants payment authority |
| Invoice source review, beneficiary approval, draft preparation and funding/reservation | Legacy invoice CRUD is available, not the complete safe workflow | Several authenticated HTTP actions exist; complete operator wizard absent | Need linked source/destination/policy/budget/funding screens rather than scripts or fabricated reviewers |
| Reviewed capacity release and funding rollover | No screen | No screen | Backend actions/tests exist; authorization/unknown outcomes cannot be discarded to free capacity |
| Recurring mandate create/review/suspend, ceilings and occurrence inspection | No management screen | Aggregate metrics only | Records, evaluator and scanner exist; service authority and automatic payment handoff remain absent |
| Advisory recurring-candidate ranking / category classification | Provider settings only | No ranking-review screen | Ranker exists; category classifier and supervisor integration remain pending; live provider configuration needed |
| Retrospective agreement per released occurrence (§18.6) | No review screen | Aggregate feedback metric only | Service/model exist; no authenticated per-occurrence review endpoint or UI found in current routes; feedback is never approval |
| Approval ownership, reminders, safe recovery and stop controls (§14.9) | Partial visibility/settings | Existing plan/collection inbox and notification foundations | Complete payment-investigation assignment, safe recovery controls and operator health still need acceptance coverage |
| Genuine human-approved current-workflow Arc settlement | **Not demonstrated** | **Not demonstrated** | Transport error, package adoption, unresolved recovery and total-cost fee policy remain open |

The redesigned review page reports **historical recorded decisions**, including expired and
simulation-only approvals; its approval count is not currently executable authority. Released
reservations remain readable history and disappear from awaiting-review counts. Reviewer setup
is account-level readiness, not permission to review one's own bill or bypass fresh validation.
Payment Submissions preserves provider wording and full six-decimal figures, with no send/retry
action. The UI does not claim that `unknown` is safe to dispatch.

**Collections usability handoff (2026-10-11):** Both panels expose the same role-checked
Collections page. `Record collection` opens **Receipt → Amount & dates → Check & save**.
Cashiers select a payment channel, copy an existing receipt/report/register number, upload
a PDF/JPG/PNG/CSV (10 MB maximum), and enter exact original-currency totals, restricted funds
and a completed period using local-time date pickers. Capture UUID and SHA-256 are generated
server-side; no hash, source slug or ISO timestamp needs to be typed. Existing source streams
stay selectable, so staff must keep the same register/channel rather than bypass overlap checks.
Uploaded proof is stored privately and included in immutable snapshot identity. Authorized
staff can download only the bound, hash-checked bytes; old digest-only API records remain
readable and explicitly have no retained upload. Review stays maker/checker separated and
final; held/rejected evidence cannot be edited or approved later through this page. Overview
counts are recorded decisions, not spendable balances. Capture/review still changes no student
balance, does not establish a bank balance, never funds Arc and never grants payment authority.
Regression coverage includes both panels, upload validation/privacy, duplicate/idempotency
protection, the signed upload HTTP endpoint, timezone identity and independent review. Browser coverage tests wizard navigation,
calendar selection and save from a signed completed-upload fixture; installed Pest browser
server does not parse multipart uploads, so end-to-end browser multipart transport is not claimed verified.

**Known dashboard audit debt:** `AutonomyLaneWidget` still hardcodes “None approved” and old
“neither exists” wording, while `EvidenceTimelineWidget` still says “No executor is shipped”.
The executor and mandate records now exist; those widgets must read their real records before
the entire §14.9 dashboard can be called truthful. `AutomationLaneStats` also exists but is not
in the admin dashboard's explicit widget list. Presence of a widget class is not deployment.

Next work, in dependency order:

1. **B0 portal safety (§14.10):** audit existing tuition postings read-only and finish the live
   gap — obtain a rail that can enforce the accepted fee ceiling (the installed Circle CLI
   refuses), configure a provider wallet, and prove one consented transfer end to end before any
   operator enables submission. The consent, fee-bound, stop-guard and no-resend contracts are in
   place; resolve async transport/package behavior for the outgoing path too. No blind retry or
   rewrite.
2. **B1–B3 intake integration:** automatically import verified digital receipts into Collections
   with allocation/source links and independent financial-use review; exclude duplicates,
   restrictions and simulation from real cash. Add student history/attention queues and link
   committed receipt/review events to existing bounded planning and supervisor advice.
3. Complete the normal source-to-reservation operator flow, funding renewal/release controls,
   truthful dashboard bindings and investigation ownership. Prove one actual independent
   staff authorization reaches one matching verified Arc testnet transfer; never synthesize consent.
   Preserve unresolved outbox #3 while investigating transport errors and duplicate attempt risks.
4. Add standing-mandate and occurrence screens, reviewed ceilings/revocation, then explicit
   institution-scoped service authority for release-to-submission. Initial allowance stays zero.
5. Add advisory-ranking review and retrospective per-occurrence feedback, keeping feedback,
   proposal acceptance, payment authorization and verified settlement distinct. Finish fee-cost
   policy and college pilot evidence before claiming production readiness.

## 17. End-to-End Fee-to-Vendor Trace — What Is Built and What Is Not

**Purpose:** answer "how do fees get collected, where does the money go, and how do vendors
get paid" step by step, with the build status of each arrow. The demo and any reviewer must
be able to see which arrow is live without reading the source.

### 17.1 The trace

| # | Step | Actor | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1A | Existing-channel collection | College's existing cash/bank channel; cashier captures source proof | Supported aggregate evidence lane; real bank settlement stays outside OpenSinop |
| 1B | Optional direct portal attempt | Student Pay Now → quote/pay API → generated wallet → configured treasury | Immutable quote/consent, expiring fee ceiling, chain/purpose/stop guards, provider-handle observation and no-resend recovery exist (B0 slice); a live run is unproven because the installed rail cannot enforce the accepted fee ceiling and refuses to sign |
| 2A | Record manual receipts | `CaptureCollectionBatch` → `CollectionBatch` | Built; private upload and three-step entry in both panels |
| 2B | Verify, allocate and import digital receipt | Matching movement predicate → posted payment → reconciliation into source-linked Collections | Built: verified-path posting, immutable consent/settlement provenance, explicit staff reconciliation and an off-by-default unattended intake that is stricter (verified attempt proof, named non-payer owner, derived capture identity). Staff-side attention views remain open |
| 3 | Independent financial reconciliation | Separate reviewer checks manual sources or digital receipt attribution/category/restrictions | Existing independent batch review covers imported receipts; category/ownership/attention workflows remain incomplete |
| 4 | Staff selects the bill set and allocation | Human → `CaptureBudgetSnapshot` with `bill_ids`, `allocation` | ✅ Built |
| 5 | Bill source evidence captured and reviewed | Maker → `InvoiceVersion`; separate checker → `approve_evidence` | ✅ Built |
| 6 | Budget snapshot binds reviewed receipts | Human → `BudgetSnapshot` schema v3 with selected collection review ids and derived movement total | Built for staff-selected manual/digital reviewed batches; typed opening funds excluded when counting movement receipts. No automatic source-to-budget routing |
| 7 | **Planner walks the closed set** | **Deterministic PHP**, no model | ✅ Built |
| 8 | Supervisor records the plan decision | Human → `FinancePlanReview` (`accept_plan` / `reject_plan` / `request_correction`) | ✅ Built |
| 9 | Draft payment intent | Maker → `PaymentIntent` (`draft`, `can_execute=false`) | ✅ Built |
| 10 | Funding window and capacity hold | `FundingWindow` (15-min, block-bound) → `PaymentReservation` | ✅ Built |
| 11 | Payment authorization | Enrolled reviewer + fresh MFA/TOTP, 5-minute expiry | ✅ Built |
| 12 | **Submit to Arc** | `IsolatedPaymentExecutor` behind runtime opt-in; provider observation; `ArcSettlementVerifier` | Foundation built; genuine independently authorized current-workflow settlement **not demonstrated**; transport/recovery/package/fee gaps remain |
| 13 | **Vendor receives USDC** | Verified Arc settlement, optionally mirrored to `transactions` | ⚠️ **Proves movement, not receipt** — vendor aliases map to operator-controlled testnet recipients (§15.5) |

The manual lane remains usable without a student row. Reviewed imported pilot receipts can
now be bound into a staff-captured plan with movement/opening exclusion. The portal's consent,
provenance and no-resend recovery gates now exist (§14.10.4 B0 slice), but no live run is
authorized and testnet money is still not promoted into real college revenue. Incoming student
consent, receipt reconciliation, plan acceptance,
payment authorization and settlement are different events. No genuine current-workflow staff
approval-to-settlement run has been established; prior synthetic-reviewer records and historical
chain payments do not satisfy it. The outbound runtime remains separately opt-in and testnet-only,
and the incoming direct-payment service carries its own explicit purpose/chain/stop guard,
fee-ceiling gate and recovery-owner requirement rather than inheriting outbound flags. Step 13
proves movement to the bound pilot recipient, not that a real vendor received the college's
payment.

### 17.2 Four corrections this trace makes explicit

1. **The planner cannot choose bills.** `DepartmentBudgetPlanner::build()` iterates the
   closed set a human supplied when capturing the snapshot, sorts by due date, applies four
   cumulative boolean checks and emits `propose_human_review` or `hold`. It has no
   discovery, ranking, selection or deprioritisation. Money cannot go anywhere a human has
   not already authorised.
2. **No model runs in the finance decision path.** Every `AgentDecision::create()` call site
   is the legacy *student assistance* path (`EvaluateAssistancePolicy`,
   `PolicyEngineService`, `OpenSinopAgent`). The vendor-payment chain writes zero model output.
3. **An authorised payment still does not settle the local payable.** A verified testnet
   mirror consumes its pilot reservation and nothing else (§14.3.6). It is not college
   income, not an accounting posting and not a vendor receipt.
4. **An incoming payment still does not approve use of funds.** Portal confirmation authorizes
   the student's bounded inbound transfer only. It creates no budget allocation, policy,
   standing mandate or outgoing approval. Fake/testnet principal is not real tuition revenue;
   the current generic `CONFIRMED` transaction or changed account balance is not proof of receipt.

### 17.3 What remains before step 12 can be closed end to end

§14.4 Step 4 requires each eligible approved item to reach verified mirror settlement once.
An isolated outgoing worker and matching Arc predicate exist, but the full operator flow,
safe async provider observation/recovery and genuine human-approved live acceptance remain open.
The student portal merge supplies neither those gates nor its own equivalent receipt guarantees.

Its prerequisites, in order:

1. **Reviewed reservation release and funding rollover.** A `PaymentReservation` was
   terminal and a `FundingWindow` expired in 15 minutes with no rollover, so an unattended
   lane starved immediately. **Both are now delivered** — see "Where Things Stand".
2. **Durable outbox and attempt identity**, committed with the domain change and dispatched
   only after commit, with a recovery sweep for committed-but-undispatched work (§14.8).
   **Delivered.**
3. **The executor itself, plus the settlement predicate.** **Delivered.**

**Remaining code and operator work:** adopt/verify async gateway compatibility, resolve the
existing unknown attempt without resending, fix duplicate-attempt/recovery hazards, finish
source-to-reservation controls and honest total-cost bounds, and establish explicit genuine
operator authority. For the digital intake branch, first complete B0–B3 in §14.10. Only then
demonstrate a source-linked, independently authorized exact pilot outflow and matching proof.
Keep outbound runtime off until its separate opt-in decision; no mainnet or fiat authority
is implied by an incoming testnet balance.

Until that run happens, any "the agent pays the vendor" claim is false regardless of how
complete the authorization chain looks.

---

## 18. Bounded Autonomous Lane — Standing Mandate Design

**Status (2026-10-11): backend foundation delivered; operator UI and automatic execution
handoff incomplete.** Mandate/review/occurrence records, deterministic evaluator, scheduled
scanner and aggregate metrics exist. Management screens and institution-scoped service
authority do not. No genuine current-workflow automatic settlement has been demonstrated.
Section 16.6 separates available screens from backend-only capabilities.

### 18.1 The correction that shapes this design

The request was phrased as "the agent decides on its own". What must actually happen:

> **A standing human mandate decides the class of payment. Deterministic PHP decides each
> individual occurrence. The model is not in the release path at all.**

This is §14.7's "two authorization levels, not two kinds of safety": humans first authorise
institution policy and a recurring mandate, and only then may eligible occurrences run
without a further approval. A missing mandate means zero automatic payments, and §14.7 is
explicit that **an LLM cannot infer that a bill is recurring**.

Consequences a new session must not regress on:

- A provider timeout, outage or prompt injection in invoice text must be unable to release
  or block a payment.
- The autonomous lane must be **sessionless**: no browser, no chat prompt, no synchronous LLM
  call, no human present (§14.8).
- "Agent decided" is never a correct description of an automatic payment. The mandate
  decided; the evaluator confirmed the occurrence.

### 18.2 Two separate paths, deliberately not unified

| Path | Trigger | Authority | Laravel AI SDK |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Interactive (existing) | Supervisor reviews a proposal | `Approvable::needsApproval()` always returns `Approval::required` | `SettlementOperator` + `DisburseAssistance` |
| **Standing mandate** (new) | Scheduler tick, no session | Mandate record + deterministic evaluator | **None** |

The SDK's approval seam is per tool call and conversation-bound
(`PendingApproval` / `Decision` / `Decisions`, resumed through
`App\Ai\Approvals\ApprovalResumeGate`). That is correct for the interactive path and wrong
for an unattended one.

### 18.3 Where the SDK does earn its place

`laravel/ai` v1.0.1 is installed. Features relevant to this work:

| Feature | Use here | Constraint |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Middleware wraps each generation step** (`PendingStep`) | Strip the money tool from the agent *mid-loop* once a step budget is spent | Safety and cost, not merely throughput |
| **Classification / `Str::decide()`** | Cheap anomaly flagging on source evidence for staff attention | **Advisory only. Never gates a payment** |
| **Conversations store `steps` as one JSON column** | Gives §14.9's evidence-linked timeline: tool call and its result paired per round-trip | Pairing is not proof of settlement |
| `ToolSearch` | Do not send rarely used tools on every request | Token hygiene |
| `CodeExecution` | **Must be forbidden on any finance agent** | Sandboxed arbitrary code inside a payments loop is not a risk worth taking |
| `Approvable` + `InteractsWithApprovals` | Interactive approval seam; `needsApproval()` **is** the policy engine | Existing pattern in `DisburseAssistance` |

The autonomous lane is testable with **no AI provider configured**, and must stay that way.

### 18.4 Records to build (authorization half — zero execution authority)

Delivered with `can_execute=false`, `funds_reserved=false`, `external_funds_locked=false`,
and no wallet mutation.

- **`RecurringMandate`** — institution, department/budget, business-approved contract or
  obligation reference, vendor + currently reviewed destination version, exact
  `ARC-TESTNET`/`5042002` identity, currency and mirror mapping, start/end dates, due window,
  allowed frequency, per-occurrence amount ceiling, fee ceiling, cumulative daily and
  mandate-period limits, bound policy version, independent reviewers, revocation state.
  **Initial allowance is zero.**
- **`RecurringMandateReview`** — separate maker/checker, append-only, binds expected digest
  and predecessor. No agent or policy maker may self-authorize a mandate.
- **`MandateOccurrence`** — unique obligation + occurrence identity with no prior
  fulfilment, bound to the exact bill and current destination/policy/mapping digests.
- **`MandateReleaseEvaluator`** — pure deterministic PHP returning every check and reason.
  Emits one of `release`, `escalate` (valid but outside mandate), or `blocked` (invalid,
  restricted, insufficient, integrity or network failure — **never** an approvable override).

### 18.5 The release check

An occurrence is automatically authorised only when **every** check passes:

- It corresponds to an actual approved bill/contract period, inside the mandate dates and due
  window, with a unique obligation-plus-occurrence identity and no prior fulfilment.
- Exact bill/mirror amount is at or below the approved ceiling. Changed price, scope or
  destination is held for renewed review — never guessed from last month's payment.
- Current source, collection, policy and destination evidence remain valid, and the separately
  approved mapping still matches. Stale or changed evidence requires fresh review.
- It fits approved budget and actual available USDC after reserves, restrictions,
  commitments, **all** active holds and fee protection.
- Per-payment and cumulative caps count submitted/unknown attempts, settled spending and
  outstanding reservations without double-counting. No bill splitting, no mandate reset.
- Rail/session/funding readiness and the stop switch permit new submission. Durable
  authorization and outbox are recorded **before** external I/O; the isolated executor
  revalidates independently.

At the exact boundary `amount <= ceiling` is permitted if every other check passes. An
otherwise-valid bill outside mandate scope goes to human review. Missed cycles do not
auto-pay an unbounded backlog; catch-up requires reviewed scope and caps. A recurring
schedule creates a work item, not a new debt, price agreement or consent.

### 18.6 Metrics — and the caveat that makes them honest

§14.6 requires counting separately: auto-authorized, human-review, held/rejected,
submitted, verified and pending/failed. **Automatic work must remain visible even when no
approval notification is needed.**

For "how often the admin agreed with the agent", two distinct and separately labelled
metrics:

1. **Approval-as-is rate** = approved-as-is ÷ resolved human-reviewed original proposals
   (approved-as-is + edited + rejected). Holds and pending are reported separately. An edit
   is not approval of the original proposal and needs its own successor authorization.
   Repeated reviews or revisions must not inflate the count.
2. **Retrospective agreement rate** — a *sample* of automatically released occurrences is
   later shown to the responsible supervisor, who records whether they would have made the
   same decision. §14.6 is explicit: this is **retrospective feedback, not per-item approval
   and not proof of correctness**. It must be labelled as such on the dashboard and in any
   exported evidence, and it must never be presented as an authorization metric.

### 18.7 Dependency chain — the lane cannot be built first

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    A[Reviewed reservation release<br/>+ funding rollover ✅] --> B[Durable outbox<br/>+ attempt identity ✅]
    B --> C[Isolated executor<br/>+ Arc settlement verification ✅]
    C --> D[Recurring mandate<br/>+ occurrence + evaluator]
    D --> E[B5 capped autonomous lane<br/>reachable without a browser]
```

Building D first produces a lane that authorises payments it cannot execute, which is
worse than not having it: the dashboard would show "auto-authorized" against money that
never moves. **The correct next implementation batch is A, then B, then C, then D.**

**Status (2026-10-11): A, B and C are delivered and tested.** The chain has still never run
against a live network, so D now has one more prerequisite besides the code: a live testnet run
of C with an operator decision on testnet submission authority. Until that run exists, D would
be an auto-authorising lane sitting on top of a submission path that has only ever been exercised
under mocks — the exact "authorises payments it cannot execute" failure the ordering exists to
prevent.

### 18.8 Decisions this section requires

1. Confirm the standing-mandate framing: the mandate decides the class, PHP decides each
   occurrence, and the model never authorises an automatic payment.
2. Confirm the dependency order in §18.7 — in particular that the executor chain precedes
   the mandate rather than running in parallel with it.
3. Agree the initial allowance is **zero** and that enabling it requires a separately
   reviewed mandate with a named owner, not a configuration toggle.
4. Confirm that retrospective agreement (§18.6) is acceptable evidence for a hackathon
   audience, and that it will always be labelled retrospective.

## 19. JEV Advisory Decision Analytics, Human Concurrence Tracking, and Background AI Agent Execution

### 19.1 Purpose and Architectural Grounding

Institutional deployment requires granular governance telemetry over agent decisions. Section 19 specifies the analytics engine, telemetry pipelines, and background execution runtime for JEV (Junior Evaluation & Verification) advisory actions and human supervisor decisions.

The design enforces strict boundaries:
- **JEV decisions are advisory:** The model never releases funds or commits irreversible state changes.
- **Human authority is authoritative:** Approvals, holds, rejections, and manual overrides remain durable audit records with verifiable user IDs and timestamps.
- **Background autonomy:** Policy evaluation pipelines and scheduled sweeps run asynchronously in background workers without blocking browser requests.

### 19.2 Telemetry Metrics & Decision Taxonomy

The analytics service (`App\Services\JevAnalyticsService`) aggregates two core dimensions:

1. **JEV Advisory Decisions**:
   - `match`: Policy rules and category classification matched with required confidence; ready for staff concurrence.
   - `needs_review`: Ambiguous policy conditions, high risk, or edge case requiring human review before proceeding.
   - `hold`: Policy controls violated, budget constraints reached, or verification anomaly detected; transaction placed on administrative hold.
   - `exempt`: Standard exempted transaction type or rule exclusion.
   - `in_progress` / `queued`: Evaluation queued or running in background.
   - Category distribution: Tracking matched policy categories (e.g., `teaching-materials`, `capital-equipment`) with item counts and average confidence scores.

2. **Staff Concurrence & Review Efficiency**:
   - `approval_rate`: Fraction of reviewed decisions where staff issued approval (`total_approved ÷ total_reviewed`).
   - `concurrence_rate`: Rate at which human reviewers concurred with JEV's recommendation vs overriding it (`concurrence_count ÷ total_reviewed`).
   - `override_rate`: Rate of manual staff intervention countermanding the agent's recommendation (`override_count ÷ total_reviewed`).
   - `time_to_approval`: Measurement of latency between policy evaluation completion and staff review resolution:
     - `avg_time_to_approval_seconds` & human-readable formatting (`Xm Ys` or `Xh Ym`).
     - `fastest_approval_seconds` and `slowest_approval_seconds`.

3. **Time-Series Trends**:
   - 14-day daily bucketed time series aggregating daily totals, matches, needs_review, holds, exempts, approvals, and overrides for visual charting.

### 19.3 Dual Interface Implementation

1. **Filament Finance Panel**:
   - Page: `App\Filament\Pages\JevAnalyticsDashboard` accessible to authorized finance officers and admins.
   - Widgets:
     - `JevDecisionSummaryWidget`: Stat tiles displaying total evaluations, active holds, policy matches, approval rate, staff concurrence rate, and average approval time.
     - `JevDecisionBreakdownChart`: Doughnut chart visualizing the split between Match, Needs Review, Hold, and Exempt.
     - `JevApprovalConcurrenceChart`: Bar chart contrasting Staff Concurred, Manual Overrides, Rejections, and Pending Review.
     - `JevDecisionsTrendChart`: Stacked bar chart tracking 14-day volume of evaluations, holds, and approvals.
     - `JevCategoryDistributionChart`: Horizontal bar chart detailing matched policy categories and model confidence.
     - Interactive recent audit table with status pills, expandable metadata, and search filters.

2. **Inertia / React SPA Dashboard**:
   - Controller: `App\Http\Controllers\JevAnalyticsController` at `GET /finance/jev-analytics`.
   - Component: `resources/js/pages/finance/analytics.tsx` offering interactive period filtering (`all`, `today`, `7_days`, `14_days`, `30_days`), source filtering (`all`, `collection`, `transaction`, `budget_snapshot`), SVG trend graphs, category confidence progress bars, and modal inspection dialogs.

### 19.4 AI Provider & Model Configuration (OpenAI-Compatible)

The AI gateway is fully configurable for any OpenAI-compatible API endpoint (e.g. Ollama, vLLM, LiteLLM, or custom proxies) and modern LLM models (e.g. `ag/gemini-3.8-flash-high`, `llama3.1`, `gpt-4o-mini`):
- **Base URL:** Configured via `OPENAI_COMPATIBLE_URL` or `AI_LOCAL_URL` (e.g. `http://localhost:11434/v1` or custom gateway)
- **Default Model:** Configured via `OPENAI_COMPATIBLE_MODEL` or `AI_LOCAL_MODEL` (e.g. `ag/gemini-3.8-flash-high`)
- **Open-Source (OSS) Deployment Note:** No proprietary or hardcoded endpoints are enforced. Operators configure their own endpoint and API key in `.env`.
- **Configuration files:** `config/ai.php`, `app/Models/AiProvider.php`, and `.env.example`.

### 19.5 Background Agent Execution & Queue Scheduling

To ensure autonomous execution without synchronous browser wait times:
1. **Queued Evaluation Job:** `App\Jobs\EvaluateInstitutionPolicy` executes advisory evaluations asynchronously with one attempt (`tries = 1`); unavailable or changed evidence concludes `needs_review`. Request a fresh run after restoring service; do not describe this as exponential provider retry.
2. **Background Dispatch Command:** `App\Console\Commands\DispatchPolicyEvaluations` (`app:dispatch-policy-evaluations`) sweeps queued evaluations and dispatches jobs onto the queue worker.
3. **Scheduler Integration:** `routes/console.php` schedules:
   - `app:dispatch-policy-evaluations`: Runs every minute (`->everyMinute()`) to process incoming policy requests.
   - `eduflow:autonomous-pipeline-bridge --latest`: Runs every 5 minutes (`->everyFiveMinutes()`) when autonomous pipeline processing is enabled.

## 20. Multi-Institution Shared-Database Architecture, Student Web3 Wallets & Arc Mainnet

**Delivery qualification:** this section describes direction and partial configuration/onboarding surfaces, not certified multi-tenant or mainnet payment operation. Current acceptance remains testnet-bound and requires object-level isolation and genuine authorized settlement proof. Where it conflicts with §14 safety gates, those gates prevail.

### 20.1 Overview & Motivation
Institutions need a frictionless way to self-host or join a shared-database instance hosting multiple schools simultaneously without cross-tenant interference. Students simultaneously need sovereign Web3 wallet registration on Arc (supporting both Arc Mainnet and Testnet) to receive stipends, grants, and verify tuition payment claims without requiring manual operator intervention.

### 20.2 Shared Database Multi-Tenancy Resolution
1. **Dynamic Context Resolution (`App\Services\InstallationInstitution`):**
   - Resolves the active organization tenant across priority layers:
     - Explicit route parameter (`institution_id`, `institution`, or slug/domain).
     - Active session context (`session('current_organization_id')`).
     - Authenticated user's organization (`$user->organization_id`) or linked student record (`$user->student->organization_id`).
     - Safe fallback: In single-institution installations or initial CLI seeders, resolves the sole primary organization. When `Organization::count() > 1`, calls without an explicit tenant context fail closed (`null` / `require()` throws `RuntimeException`), preventing accidental cross-tenant data leaks.
2. **Multi-School Schema Enhancements:**
   - Table `organizations`: Added `slug`, `domain`, `country`, `timezone`, `currency`, `network`, `treasury_address`, `treasury_mode`, and `metadata`.
   - Tables `users` & `students`: Added `organization_id` foreign key associations.
   - Guard relaxation: `GuardSingleInstitution::withoutGuard()` permits tenant provisioning in multi-school installations while protecting single-tenant production deployments.

### 20.3 Institution Self-Serve Onboarding (`/institutions/register`)
- **Route:** `GET /institutions/register` & `POST /institutions/register` (`App\Http\Controllers\InstitutionRegistrationController`).
- **UI:** Bulletin design system view (`resources/js/pages/institutions/register.tsx`).
- **Capabilities:**
  - School details: Name, subdomain/slug, country, timezone, accounting currency (`USDC` or `EURC`).
  - Network rail: **Arc Mainnet** (Chain ID `5040`, `https://rpc.arc.network`) or **Arc Testnet** (Chain ID `5042`, `https://testnet-rpc.arc.network`).
  - Treasury mode: Autonomous Circle Agent Smart Account (provisioned via Lepton Agent) or manual cold/multisig EVM address.
  - Initial Super-Administrator account provisioning with automatic category templates and baseline financial policies.

### 20.4 Student Registration & Cryptographic Wallet Linking (`/register`)
- **Dual-Path Registration (`App\Actions\Fortify\CreateNewUser`, `resources/js/pages/auth/register.tsx`):**
  - **1-Click Browser Wallet:** Connects via EIP-1193 provider (MetaMask, Rainbow, Phantom, Brave) with personal sign verification (`personal_sign`) to cryptographically prove key ownership.
  - **Manual Entry Fallback:** Validates 40-character hex EVM address (`0x[a-fA-F0-9]{40}`) for smart contract accounts or cold storage.
  - Academic metadata: Student ID number, department, and institution selection.
  - Automatic provisioning: Creates authenticated `User` (role `student`), persists `Student` model linked to institution, and provisions initial `TuitionAccount`.

### 20.5 Arc Mainnet & Testnet Treasury Rails
- Native USDC gas token abstraction on Arc Mainnet (Chain `5040`) and Arc Testnet (Chain `5042`).
- Seamless gateway resolution through `App\Gateways\ArcNetworkGateway` and `yukazakiri/lepton-agent`.
- Support for dual custody models: operator-autonomous Circle Agent Wallets and externally owned / multisig cold treasury accounts.
